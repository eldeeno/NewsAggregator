Look into more details – we’ve conceded four goals from set pieces this season. We’ve changed our full-backs – we’ve changed a bit more than our full-backs – but when I think about the goals we’ve conceded the first thing that comes to mind is not that the full-backs are a problem.</p> <p>“It’s always a team performance. Last season, we hardly conceded because 11 players worked incredibly hard to stop the other team having a chance. They are working incredibly hard this season but set pieces are a game in themselves sometimes. We have to go back to that and we have to prove in the upcoming games and months that we don’t normally concede from set pieces. It’s something we definitely have to improve. I see teams in the Premier League that win games by set pieces and we lose games by set pieces.”</p> <p>Galatasaray scored 24 set-piece goals out of a total of 91 last season, although that figure includes penalties. Slot, who left Federico Chiesa out of Liverpool’s travelling squad due to what he described as a “little niggle”, believes set pieces are becoming increasingly decisive.</p> <p>He added: “More and more in football it is becoming a set-piece game. It is a style you see more and more, especially in the Premier League because you can do much more such as attack a goalkeeper or even touch a goalkeeper and it’s not a foul. I know Galatasaray are strong at set pieces but we have been a force at set pieces last season. We won our last Champions League game with a set piece from Virgil [van Dijk].”</p> <p>Hugo Ekitiké, meanwhile, has said he welcomes the signing of Alexander Isak despite the threat posed to his place at centre-forward by the record £125m striker. Liverpool’s summer signing from Eintracht Frankfurt insisted: “We play in such a big club. I can’t see any big clubs playing with just one striker in the squad. It is good that Alex is here. For me, at my age, I have a lot of things to improve and learn.

However, unions have warned that the future pay increases will need “substantially more” investment.</p> <p>The move was promised as part of a slew of measures in Labour’s workers’ rights package, intended to create better pay and working conditions in the struggling care sector, where low pay and insecure work have led to a recruitment crisis.</p> <p>The final increase will be negotiated by the body – the first of its kind in the country – with the budget set by government also used to improve conditions at work.</p> <p>Care workers are not expected to feel the benefits of the change for several years. After the employment bill passes parliament, there will be a consultation on the new pay body, which will be formally convened next year. It will conduct the negotiations in 2027, so that the pay and conditions improvements can come into force the following year.</p> <p>It is hoped that the enhanced pay and conditions will improve retention in the sector, where a vacancy rate of nearly 10% is expected to be exacerbated by a crackdown on visas for overseas care workers.</p> <p>Both employers and trade unions will sit on the new body. Its recommendations will be applicable across the sector, for private and public sector workers. The cash will come from the £4bn allocated in the spending review to adult social care.</p> <p>Streeting will say at the Labour conference on Monday that the government “will no longer accept a system built on poverty pay and zero-hour insecurity”.</p> <p>He will pledge that the fair pay agreement will be backed in law. This was a key demand of care sector unions Unison and GMB, whom the government has been keen to keep onside amid faltering relations with other unions.</p> <p>Unison’s general secretary, Christina McAnea, said: “This is the first government to take the many problems in social care seriously, and more importantly, to act on them. The best way to begin getting a grip on this complex, fragmented sector in crisis is to improve wages through a fair pay agreement, backed by proper funding.”</p> <p>But she said that although £500m was welcome, “substantially more will be needed to deliver the national care service the public deserves”.</p> <p>She added: “Ministers will have to increase the funding behind the fair pay agreement at the earliest opportunity.

She said: “I think Nigel Farage is playing the trick that I think he tries to play very regularly, which is he will say something that, technically he can say is not racist, but what he really knows is he’s blown a very, very loud dog whistle to every racist in the country.</p> <p>“That means he can always sort of claim plausible deniability and say: ‘Well, you know, technically, my policy on ILR, for example, looking at indefinite need to remain for people who’ve been in this country for many years’, he’ll say: ‘Well, that will apply to white people as well as non-white people’.</p> <p>“Technically, that would be true, but he also knows he sent a very clear signal to every racist in the land that those who have made their homes in this country have come from other places, might one day have their status ripped off.</p> <p>“It’s a little bit worse than racist,” she said. “If it was racist, in a funny way, it would be easier to deal with.”</p> <p>Mahmood said a tide of racism across the UK can be fought against, and that she had had sleepless nights after her family had been abused recently near their home in Small Heath.</p> <p>“What is happening now is something much deeper and much more pervasive, and it does feel like it’s everywhere at the moment,” she said. </p> <p>“Members of my own, my own family, just in the last couple of weeks … have been called fucking Paki in Birmingham, in places that I go to regularly with my family, where we hang out, and I can’t pretend to you that it doesn’t make me have sleepless nights. You know, there’s some parts of Birmingham, I’m sort of second-guessing whether I can go back to again.”</p> <p>She had earlier described a minority of those who took to the streets of London for the “unite the kingdom” rally as “heirs to the skinheads … of old” as she called on Labour to fight a slide into “ethno-nationalism”.</p> <p>In a speech which addressed the growth in extreme right populism and its links to immigration head on, Mahmood said that “division within this country will grow” if her party fails to control the number of immigrants coming to the UK.</p> <p>It comes as Home Office sources disclosed that she is examining a new set of restrictions to halt claims of settlement from more than a million people who were granted visas between 2021 and 2024, during a period known as the “Boriswave”.</p> <p>In her speech to the Labour conference, Mahmood referred to the London march led by Tommy Robinson as evidence that the far right was attempting to write Muslims and other ethnic minorities out of the definition of Englishness and Britishness.</p> <p>Between 110,000 and 150,000 people turned out for the rally on 13 September, according to the Metropolitan police.</p> <p>She said: “Just days into this job, on 13 September, 150,000 people marched through London.</p> <p>“They did so under the banner of a convicted criminal and a former BNP [British National party] member.</p> <p>“While not everyone was violent, some were. Twenty-six police officers were injured as they tried to keep the peace.</p> <p>“And while not everyone chanted racist slogans, some did, clear that in their view of this country, I have no place.</p> <p>“It would be easy to dismiss this as nothing but an angry minority … but to dismiss what happened that day would be to ignore something bigger, something broader, that is happening across this country. The story of who we are is contested.”</p> <p>Claiming “the patriotism of Orwell”, Mahmood, a practising Muslim, said: “Patriotism, a force for good, is turning into something smaller.</p> <p>“Something more like ethno-nationalism, which struggles to accept that someone who looks like me, and has a faith like mine, can truly be English or British.”</p> <p>She said working-class communities would turn away from Labour and “seek solace in the false promises of Farage” if the government failed to act on migration concerns.</p> <p>“They will turn towards something smaller, something narrower, something less welcoming, and the division within this country will grow,” she said.</p> <p>Mahmood attempted to appeal to a Labour membership which has in the past reacted against tough immigration restrictions, saying she would solve the issue of people crossing the Channel from France in small boats by doing “whatever it takes”.</p> <p>“In solving this crisis, you may not always like what I do,” she said. “We will have to question some of the assumptions and legal constraints that have lasted for a generation and more.</p> <p>“But unless we have control of our borders and until we can decide who comes in and who must leave, we will never be the open, tolerant and generous country that I know we all believe in.”</p>\",\n            \"excerpt\": \"Home secretary also tells Labour conference fringe event of the abuse her family have been subjected to recently\",\n            \"author\": \"Rajeev Syal Home affairs editor\",\n            \"category\": \"Politics\",\n            \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/29/shabana-mahmood-calls-nigel-farage-worse-than-racist-over-dog-whistle-politics\",\n            \"image_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/882765e2212062a28aa1a6851063aad225674411/418_0_4164_3333/500.jpg\",\n            \"published_at\": \"2025-09-29T19:57:57.000000Z\",\n            \"source\": {\n                \"id\": 2,\n                \"name\": \"The Guardian\",\n                \"slug\": \"guardian\"\n            },\n            \"created_at\": \"2025-09-29T20:05:11.000000Z\",\n            \"updated_at\": \"2025-09-29T20:05:11.000000Z\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 50,\n            \"title\": \"Trump demands Hamas accept US plan to ‘end Gaza conflict’ as Netanyahu says Israel will ‘finish the job’ if they don’t\",\n            \"content\": \"<div id=\\\"block-68dae23c8f088bee03e6fb6a\\\" class=\\\"block\\\" data-block-contributor=\\\"\\\"> <p class=\\\"block-time published-time\\\"> <time datetime=\\\"2025-09-29T19:47:42.606Z\\\">8.47pm <span class=\\\"timezone\\\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\\\"block-elements\\\">  <p>Senate majority leader <strong>John Thune</strong> told reporters before heading to the White House that he believes “there will be multiple opportunities to vote on keeping the government open” if they can’t do so tomorrow.</p> <p>“I would expect additional opportunities,” he said.</p> </div>   <p class=\\\"block-time updated-time\\\">Updated <time datetime=\\\"2025-09-29T19:48:58.147Z\\\">at 8.48pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\\\"block-68dadfe48f08206a90f091ef\\\" class=\\\"block is-key-event\\\" data-block-contributor=\\\"\\\"> <p class=\\\"block-time published-time\\\"> <time datetime=\\\"2025-09-29T19:37:55.403Z\\\">8.37pm <span class=\\\"timezone\\\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\\\"block-title\\\">Hamas official says group has not received written Trump's Gaza peace plan</h2>  <div class=\\\"block-elements\\\">  <p>Hamas official <strong>Mahmoud Mardawi</strong> has reiterated that the group has not yet received Donald Trump’s written Gaza peace plan.</p> <p>He gave the remarks in an interview with Al Jazeera Mubasher TV shortly after Trump’s joint press conference with Benjamin Netanyahu in which the Israeli prime minister expressed support for the US plan but vowed to “finish the job” if Hamas rejected it.</p> </div>   <p class=\\\"block-time updated-time\\\">Updated <time datetime=\\\"2025-09-29T19:42:14.064Z\\\">at 8.42pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\\\"block-68dadfba8f080edbe2663da1\\\" class=\\\"block\\\" data-block-contributor=\\\"\\\"> <p class=\\\"block-time published-time\\\"> <time datetime=\\\"2025-09-29T19:36:50.190Z\\\">8.36pm <span class=\\\"timezone\\\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\\\"block-elements\\\">  <p>“I’m going to the White House.

Here is the full text:</p> <ul> <li><p>Gaza will be a de-radicalized terror-free zone that does not pose a threat to its neighbors.</p></li> <li><p>Gaza will be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who have suffered more than enough.</p></li> <li><p>If both sides agree to this proposal, the war will immediately end. Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed upon line to prepare for a hostage release. During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal.</p></li> <li><p>Within 72 hours of Israel publicly accepting this agreement, all hostages, alive and deceased, will be returned.</p></li> <li><p>Once all hostages are released, Israel will release 250 life sentence prisoners plus 1700 Gazans who were detained after Oct. 7, 2023, including all women and children detained in that context. For every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 deceased Gazans.</p></li> <li><p>Once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful coexistence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries.</p></li> <li><p>Upon acceptance of this agreement, full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip. At a minimum, aid quantities will be consistent with what was included in the Jan. 19, 2025, agreement regarding humanitarian aid, including rehabilitation of infrastructure (water, electricity, sewage), rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries, and entry of necessary equipment to remove rubble and open roads.</p></li> <li><p>Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner with either party. Opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under the Jan. 19, 2025 agreement.</p></li> <li><p>Gaza will be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza.</p></li> <li><p>This committee will be made up of qualified Palestinians and international experts, with oversight and supervision by a new international transitional body, the “Board of Peace,” which will be headed and chaired by President Donald J. Trump, with other members and heads of State to be announced, including Former Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p></li> <li><p>This body will set the framework and handle the funding for the redevelopment of Gaza until such time as the Palestinian Authority has completed its reform program, as outlined in various proposals, including President Trump’s peace plan in 2020 and the Saudi-French proposal, and can securely and effectively take back control of Gaza. This body will call on best international standards to create modern and efficient governance that serves the people of Gaza and is conducive to attracting investment.</p></li> <li><p>A Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energize Gaza will be created by convening a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East. Many thoughtful investment proposals and exciting development ideas have been crafted by well-meaning international groups, and will be considered to synthesize the security and governance frameworks to attract and facilitate these investments that will create jobs, opportunity, and hope for future Gaza.</p></li> <li><p>A special economic zone will be established with preferred tariff and access rates to be negotiated with participating countries.</p></li> <li><p>No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return. We will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza.</p></li> <li><p>Hamas and other factions agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form. All military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt. There will be a process of demilitarization of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning, and supported by an internationally funded buy back and reintegration program all verified by the independent monitors. New Gaza will be fully committed to building a prosperous economy and to peaceful coexistence with their neighbors.</p></li> <li><p>A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people.</p></li> <li><p>The United States will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza. The ISF will train and provide support to vetted Palestinian police forces in Gaza, and will consult with Jordan and Egypt who have extensive experience in this field. This force will be the long-term internal security solution. The ISF will work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with newly trained Palestinian police forces. It is critical to prevent munitions from entering Gaza and to facilitate the rapid and secure flow of goods to rebuild and revitalize Gaza. A de-confliction mechanism will be agreed upon by the parties.</p></li> <li><p>Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. As the ISF establishes control and stability, the Israel Defense Forces (I.D.F.) will withdraw based on standards, milestones, and time frames linked to demilitarization that will be agreed upon between the IDF, ISF, the guarantors, and the United States, with the objective of a secure Gaza that no longer poses a threat to Israel, Egypt, or its citizens. Practically, the IDF will progressively hand over the Gaza territory it occupies to the ISF according to an agreement they will make with the transitional authority until they are withdrawn completely from Gaza, save for a security perimeter presence that will remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat.</p></li> <li><p>In the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operation, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF to the ISF.</p></li> <li><p>An interfaith dialogue process will be established based on the values of tolerance and peaceful coexistence to try and change mind-sets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis by emphasizing the benefits that can be derived from peace.</p></li> <li><p>While Gaza redevelopment advances and when the PA reform program is faithfully carried out, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.</p></li> <li><p>The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\\\"block-time updated-time\\\">Updated <time datetime=\\\"2025-09-29T18:51:48.915Z\\\">at 7.51pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\\\"block-68dac8e08f080edbe2663c9e\\\" class=\\\"block is-key-event\\\" data-block-contributor=\\\"\\\"> <p class=\\\"block-time published-time\\\"> <time datetime=\\\"2025-09-29T18:02:02.069Z\\\">7.02pm <span class=\\\"timezone\\\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\\\"block-title\\\">Netanyahu 'expressed deep regret' that Israeli strike on Doha killed Qatari serviceman, says White House</h2>  <div class=\\\"block-elements\\\">  <p>Here is the White House’s readout confirming the trilateral call reported earlier during which Benjamin Netanyahu <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/sep/29/donald-trump-benjamin-netanyahu-gaza-white-house-us-politics-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68dabc688f08206a90f0905c#block-68dabc688f08206a90f0905c\\\">apologized to Qatari PM</a> Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani over Israel’s strikes on Doha earlier this month.</p> <blockquote class=\\\"quoted\\\"> <p>Today, President Donald J.

My name is Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next hour or so.</p> <p>We start with news that <strong>Donald Trump will host Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Monday</strong>, with the US president pushing a Gaza peace proposal after a slew of western leaders embraced Palestinian statehood in defiance of American and Israeli opposition.</p> <p>In Netanyahu’s fourth visit since Trump returned to office in January, the right-wing Israeli leader will be looking to shore up his country’s most important relationship as it faces growing international isolation nearly two years into its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Reuters reported.</p> <p>He can expect a warm welcome compared to the chilly reception he received when he spoke on Friday before the UN general assembly where many delegates walked out in protest.</p> <p>Netanyahu went on to deliver a blistering attack on what he called a “disgraceful decision” over the past week by Britain, France, Canada, Australia and several other countries to recognize Palestinian statehood, a major diplomatic shift by top US allies.</p> <p>Trump, who had criticized the recognition moves as a prize to Hamas, told Reuters on Sunday he hopes to get Netanyahu’s agreement on a framework to end the war in the Palestinian territory and free the remaining hostages held by Hamas.</p> <p>“We’re getting a very good response because Bibi wants to make the deal too,” Trump said in a telephone interview, using Netanyahu’s nickname. “Everybody wants to make the deal.”</p> <p>He credited leaders of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Jordan and Egypt for their assistance and said the deal aims to go beyond Gaza to a broader Middle East peace.</p> <p>“It’s called peace in the Middle East, more than Gaza. Gaza is a part of it. But it’s peace in the Middle East,” he said.</p> <p>In other developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>More than 100,000 federal workers are to formally resign on Tuesday, the largest such mass event in US history, as part of a <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\\\">Trump administration</a> program designed to make sweeping cuts to the federal workforce.</strong> With Congress facing a deadline of Tuesday to authorize more funding or spark a <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/27/government-shutdown-explainer\\\">government shutdown</a>, the White House has also ordered federal agencies to draw up plans for large-scale firings of workers if the partisan fight fails to yield a deal.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Donald Trump has reversed course and is purportedly planning to host a bipartisan gathering of the top four US congressional leaders at the White House on Monday afternoon in a last-ditch effort to avoid a looming government shutdown</strong>, the House speaker and the US president’s fellow Republican, Mike Johnson, said on Sunday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/25/james-comey-fbi-director-indictment\\\">indictment</a> of former FBI director <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/james-comey\\\">James Comey</a> is part of a concerted effort by <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\\\">Donald Trump</a> to “rewrite history” in his favor</strong>, a former senior White House lawyer claimed on Sunday as he warned of more retribution to come for the president’s political opponents.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The mayor of <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\\\">New York City</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-adams\\\">Eric Adams</a>, announced on Sunday that he was abandoning his faltering bid to win re-election, just over a month before election day.</strong> Adams, who was trailing in the polls, was elected as a <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\\\">Democrat</a> but ran for re-election as an independent after he was indicted on federal corruption charges, which were <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/eric-adams-corruption-case-dismissed\\\">then dropped</a> by the <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\\\">Trump administration</a> in exchange for his cooperation on immigration raids.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Children, including the very young, have been spending weeks or months in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention facility in a remote part of Texas where outside monitors have heard accounts of shortages of clean drinking water, chronic sleep deprivation and kids struggling for hygiene supplies and prompt medical attention</strong>, as revealed in a stark new court filing.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\\\"block-time updated-time\\\">Updated <time datetime=\\\"2025-09-29T10:58:06.490Z\\\">at 11.58am BST</time></p>  </div>\",\n            \"excerpt\": \"Netanyahu says he supports Trump’s Gaza peace plan but Hamas still must agree to proposal\",\n            \"author\": \"Lois Beckett (now);

This may be an impossible task, given that the magic and cliches of popular music often go hand in hand, and Deliver Me from Nowhere certainly has its spoof-worthy moments. I went in braced for success montages, leaden flashbacks and capital-R Realizations, and at times met them. (Though to be clear, the expected treat of watching White, of the Bear and Calvin Klein underwear ad fame, tear up the stage as The Boss is still exactly that.) But more often I was won over by its diversions in form – its specificities, its smallness and its portrait of mental fragility.</p> <p>That’s largely down to its rewardingly limited scope. Based on the book by Warren Zane (and informed by Springsteen’s 2016 memoir), Deliver Me from Nowhere burrows into a pivotal phase of life for both rockstars and civilians: the early 30s, when the excuses of youth start running out and demons start catching up. The bulk of the film takes place in 1981, when Springsteen returns to New Jersey after touring his first number one record, The River, on the brink of superstardom but burned out. Record execs at Columbia (embodied by David Krumholtz) want him to strike with more hits while the iron is hot; Bruce, played by White as hollow behind the brown-eye contacts, wants to hole up in a rental house in Colts Neck and tinker with the ideas that will become his 1982 album Nebraska, a folk-tinged acoustic album full of blue collar workers, outlaws, and other downtrodden outsiders in the heartland.</p>       <figure class=\\\"element element-video\\\" data-canonical-url=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQXdM3J33No\\\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\\\"480\\\" width=\\\"854\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oQXdM3J33No?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The story of Springsteen’s hard left artistic turn, inspired by Flannery O’Connor stories and TV dramas, is certainly an interesting one. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to visualize the churn of one person’s brain on fire, the ups and downs of the creative process; we end up spending a lot of time watching Bruce write lyrics in black marker indicative of overstatement – “Why???,” he writes when looking at an old headline about Charles Starkweather, whose 1958 murder spree inspired the title track. (It’s because he was “mad at the world”.) Perfunctory, too, are the black-and-white flashbacks to his working class childhood in nearby Freehold, which communicate the scarring fear of his alcoholic, abusive father (Stephen Graham), the explosive fights with his mother (Gaby Hoffmann). Same for scenes in which Bruce’s beloved manager Jon Landau (Succession’s Jeremy Strong) acts as buffer between commercial expectations and Bruce’s refusal of it.</p> <p>It’s hard, in the film’s first half, to see past Strong and White’s respective on-screen reputations, each different strains of broodingly serious. In literal tone and line delivery, they’re not terribly far removed from their most famous characters. White, in particular, takes some getting used to, the familiar ticks of Chef Carmy’s red-hot anxiety occasionally peeking through Bruce’s cool avoidance. But he eventually settles into character, especially as Bruce’s depression spirals into panic post-recording.</p> <p>Deliver Me From Nowhere picks up steam in this aftermath of genius, as Bruce’s team scramble to preserve the haunted sound of his Colts Neck bedroom demos despite all market sense. The film’s lingering focus on the technical process of recording, how cassette limitations begot a beloved sound – what Brian Eno <a href=\\\"https://diariesofnote.com/2023/12/19/the-sound-of-failure/\\\">called</a> the “sound of failure” – is a surprising highlight, at least for this viewer nostalgic for CDs. Meanwhile, Bruce’s mental health crumbles along with his relationship with local waitress Faye (Odessa Young), the film’s only composite character given one standout scene to rise above her parenthetical role exemplifying Bruce’s penchant for disappearance and need of professional help.</p> <p>Deliver Me from Nowhere thankfully avoids overly mythologizing the Boss – we see him on stage just a handful of times, in flashes; he walks around New Jersey mostly unrecognized and unbothered, the trappings of major celebrity the subject of another film. Arguably the film’s most idealized sequence – the recording of Born in the USA, also written in that bedroom – briefly blazes by like a comet; the cut ended up sitting on the shelf for three years, its popularity and political legacy outside the scope of this film. Deliver Me From Nowhere ends before that – the wins and wounds of one landmark, heart-wrenching album still fresh. I floated out of the theater to Nebraska’s rueful highlight Atlantic City, and haven’t wanted to stop listening to it since, stuck in its Americana groove – which is perhaps, ultimately, what we want from a biopic.</p> <ul> <li><p>Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere is screening at the New York film festival and will be released in Australian cinemas on 23 October and in the US and UK on 24

Musk responded on Sunday night to an X account that posts anti-immigrant content.</p> <p>Musk made the comments on his social media platform X in response to the ADL’s documentation of racist and extremist statements by members of Charlie Kirk’s group, Turning Point USA. The ADL previously defended Musk against accusations of antisemitism after he gave <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/20/trump-elon-musk-salute\\\">what were widely criticized as two fascist-style salutes</a> on stage following Trump’s inauguration.</p> <aside class=\\\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\\\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/24/charlie-kirk-conspiracies-rightwing-podcasters\\\">Rightwing podcasters run rampant with Charlie Kirk conspiracies: ‘It’s craven opportunism’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Using such false and defamatory labels about people and organizations encourages murder,” Musk said in response.</p> <p>Musk’s attacks on the ADL show that his recently positive relationship to the organization, which came to his aid after the inauguration, has soured. The ADL’s defense of Musk, who has repeatedly denied being antisemitic, led to <a href=\\\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/inside-adl-anti-defamation-league-greenblatt-zionism-trump-gaza.html\\\">immense backlash </a>from longtime donors and staff.</p> <p>The Tesla CEO also responded to several other rightwing influencer accounts targeting the ADL, some of whom have been seeking punishment of groups or individuals that have been critical of Kirk after his killing. They shared screenshots on Sunday of a page from the ADL’s website that documents <a href=\\\"https://extremism.gwu.edu/christian-identity-reborn-evolution-and-revitalization-antisemitic-theology\\\">the Christian Identity movement</a>, an extremist ideology dating back to the 19th century which promotes a racial holy war against Jews and other minority groups.</p> <p>The ADL’s page on Kirk’s organization states: “TPUSA’s leadership and activists have made multiple racist or bigoted comments and have been linked to a variety of extremists”, citing <a href=\\\"https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/turning-point-usa\\\">numerous incidents</a> such as a TPUSA chapter head posting a joke about the murder of three Black students at their university; another chapter president caught on video yelling “white power”; and the organization inviting a prominent white nationalist to speak at Iowa State University.</p> <p>“The idea that @ADL is anti-Christian is offensive and wrong. Many of our staff members are Christian. Many of our supporters are Christian. We are blessed to work with many Christian brothers and sisters in the shared fight against antisemitism and all forms of hate,” Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL’s CEO, posted. The statements from the ADL and Greenblatt did not address the page on TPUSA.</p> <p>The ADL’s backing of Musk was a rare example of an anti-hate group supporting the tech mogul, who has faced years of criticism from extremism monitors over his amplification of far-right content. Earlier this year, the head of Yad Vashem, Israel’s memorial to victims of the Holocaust, <a href=\\\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/27/nx-s1-5276084/elon-musk-german-far-right-afd-holocaust\\\">denounced Musk’s endorsement</a> of Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and his statement that Germans should move “past guilt”.</p> <p>The organization’s relationship with Musk has been a <a href=\\\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/adl-elon-musk-controversy/\\\">continual source of contention</a> for the organization, which has faced backlash in recent years over its narrowing mission and Greenblatt’s leadership.</p> <p>ADL <a href=\\\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/adl-elon-musk-controversy/\\\">staffers have previously alleged</a> that Greenblatt has pursued pro-Israel policies and cozied up to powerful actors such as Musk in a way that has undermined the ADL’s broader goal of combating extremism.</p> <p>The ADL faced <a href=\\\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/inside-adl-anti-defamation-league-greenblatt-zionism-trump-gaza.html\\\">more internal turmoil</a> earlier this year after it called Musk’s on-stage salute “an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute” and asked that “all sides should give one another a bit of grace, perhaps even the benefit of the doubt”. Since defending his gestures, the organization has criticized Musk for incidents that have included <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/09/grok-ai-praised-hitler-antisemitism-x-ntwnfb\\\">his Grok AI chatbot praising nazism</a> and calling itself “MechaHitler”.</p> <p>In another incident from 2023, Musk faced widespread criticism after he endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory on X that Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites”. Greenblatt <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2024/jan/05/adl-pro-israel-advocacy-zionism-antisemitism\\\">praised Musk days later,</a> however, after the billionaire posted that the pro-Palestinian slogan “From the river to the sea” would violate X’s content moderation policies.

An unknown number did so last year and early this year over changes to their contract that they were opposed to.</p> <p>“Online systems currently cannot distinguish between non-urgent and urgent patient queries, and with practices already understaffed and overworked, GPs fear this could lead to potentially serious and life-threatening problems being delayed or missed entirely,” the BMA said.</p> <p>“Doctors will need to be reallocated away from booked appointments to manage the potential online triage tsunami, leading to fewer GP appointments with patients.</p> <p>“GPs are worried that without any increase in practice capacity, considerable amounts of practice time will be diverted to reviewing the barrage of online requests and queries, thus reducing time for routine appointments and planned patient care.”</p> <p>The health secretary, Wes Streeting, dismissed the BMA’s concerns and insisted the changes would go ahead as planned.</p> <p>The DHSC said the move “delivers on our manifesto promise to end the 8am scramble. Patients can now contact their GP digitally whenever suits them during core hours, not just in that frantic morning rush. </p> <p>“It’s about choice and convenience. Patients can still phone or walk in, but now they’ve also got the online option available all day.</p> <p>“More people requesting bookings online means quieter phone lines for those who need to call.”</p> <p>Some of England’s 6,400 GP surgeries already operate the system the BMA is concerned about. They have found it brings “a smoother workflow and better service”, the DHSC said.</p> <p>The Patients Association said what patients wanted most from GPs was fast access to advice and care, irrespective of how they sought an appointment.</p> <p>Its chief executive, Rachel Power, said: “Patients should feel confident that when they book or request an appointment, whether online, on the phone, or in person, their needs will be assessed swiftly and safely by someone with the right training and skills to judge urgency.”</p>\",\n            \"excerpt\": \"Doctors’ union says GPs will be overwhelmed by ‘triage tsunami’ and gives ministers 48 hours to take measures\",\n            \"author\": \"Denis Campbell Health policy editor\",\n            \"category\": \"Society\",\n            \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/29/gps-doctors-england-online-appointment-booking-plan-strike-action-threat\",\n            \"image_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/21d529d3b3e11e22878da62069e78d8c6e7e8a55/422_0_2687_2150/500.jpg\",\n            \"published_at\": \"2025-09-29T19:00:36.000000Z\",\n            \"source\": {\n                \"id\": 2,\n                \"name\": \"The Guardian\",\n                \"slug\": \"guardian\"\n            },\n            \"created_at\": \"2025-09-29T20:05:11.000000Z\",\n            \"updated_at\": \"2025-09-29T20:05:11.000000Z\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 200,\n            \"title\": \"Andy Burnham hits back at Labour critics over challenge to Starmer\",\n            \"content\": \"<p>Andy Burnham has hit back at Labour colleagues who have <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/25/labour-internal-warfare-breaks-open-as-keir-starmer-and-ministers-criticise-andy-burnham\\\">criticised him for challenging Keir Starmer</a> during a Labour party conference that has been dominated by speculation over the prime minister’s leadership.</p> <p>The Greater Manchester mayor rejected attacks by members of his own party who have accused him of launching a pre-emptive putsch against Starmer, saying the criticism “sticks in my throat”.</p> <aside class=\\\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\\\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2025/sep/29/andy-burnham-live-in-conversation-podcast\\\">Andy Burnham live in conversation – podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking at a live recording of the Guardian’s Politics Weekly podcast in Liverpool, he repeatedly refused to say whether he had spoken to Labour MPs about returning to Westminster and challenging for the leadership of his party.</p> <p>But he also attempted to calm relations with Downing Street, saying he had no ability to launch a leadership campaign while he was still mayor.</p> <p>“It sticks in my throat somewhat to have people who have just arrived on the scene to be throwing some of the comments at me that they have done,” he said. “I did everything I possibly could to make this conference a success, and I would suggest more people did.”</p> <p>After days of questions about his leadership ambitions – fuelled in part by <a href=\\\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/09/24/andy-burnham-mps-want-me-to-challenge-starmer/\\\">an interview</a> he gave to the Telegraph in which he said Labour MPs had contacted him over the summer about a possible bid – Burnham tried to quell the speculation.</p> <aside class=\\\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\\\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/28/andy-burnham-climate-of-fear-labour-shutting-down-debate\\\">Andy Burnham says ‘climate of fear’ in Labour is shutting down debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I can’t launch a leadership campaign, I’m not in parliament,” he said. “So that’s the bottom line.”</p> <p>Asked whether he had discussed the idea with colleagues, he said: “I’m not going to go and say every conversation I have with every MP. I have many conversations with MPs.”</p> <p>Burnham was speaking soon after Rachel Reeves had appeared to criticise him for previous comments he made that the UK should not be in hock to the bond markets.</p> <p>The chancellor <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/29/rachel-reeves-warns-labour-figures-against-ditching-idea-relaxing-fiscal-rules\\\">said in her speech</a>: “There is nothing progressive, nothing Labour, about government using one in every £10 of public money it spends on financing debt interest.”</p> <p>Burnham hit back. He said: “If you change the way things are run, you can make public money go further … I reject entirely this idea that I am hopeless and have no idea about how to make it add up.”</p> <p>He also rejected the call from his former cabinet colleague Alan Johnson to rule out a leadership tilt. “I remember Mr Johnson not being a model of loyalty when it came to Jeremy Corbyn,” he said.</p> <p>“Someone has to speak up for some of the ideas that we need to have that plan to beat Reform.”</p> <p>He urged the prime minister to be more radical to help the party keep seats in Wales, Scotland and other parts of the UK at next May’s local and devolved elections.</p> <p>“There’s a calling for more to take to the doorstep,” he said. “If I look at the world right now, and you think of the populist right, whatever we may think about what they’re doing, they are putting big things on the table.</p> <p>“Well, we have to do the same the other way, never pandering to them, but put big ideas on the table.”</p> <p>Burnham discussed several changes he would make to the government’s economic policies, including rewriting the fiscal rules to make it easier to invest, scrapping the two-child benefit cap, imposing a land value tax and launching a review of council tax.</p> <p>He defended his previous comments about the bond markets, insisting he did not mean that the government should borrow billions of pounds more to finance policies such as ending the two-child cap.</p> <p>Instead, he said the chancellor should consider modifying her debt rule, which says debt must be forecast to fall at the end of a five-year period, to allow her to borrow more capital investment.</p> <p>He also criticised two other central planks of government policy – launching <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/26/keir-starmer-digital-id-cards-enormous-opportunity-uk\\\">digital ID cards</a> and refusing to rule out rejoining the EU.</p> <p>Talking about ID cards, which the prime minister announced on the eve of the conference as a way for employers to check whether someone has the right to work in the UK, Burnham said simply “Not now.”</p> <p>On the EU, he said: “I want to rejoin. I hope in my lifetime I see this country rejoin the European Union.</p> <p>“I believe in unions of all kinds. The union that is the UK, the European Union, trade unions, [all] benefited this country.

But it’s peace in the Middle East,” he said.</p> \\n  <p>In other developments:</p> \\n  <ul> \\n   <li><p><strong>More than 100,000 federal workers are to formally resign on Tuesday, the largest such mass event in US history, as part of a <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\\\">Trump administration</a> program designed to make sweeping cuts to the federal workforce.</strong> With Congress facing a deadline of Tuesday to authorize more funding or spark a <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/27/government-shutdown-explainer\\\">government shutdown</a>, the White House has also ordered federal agencies to draw up plans for large-scale firings of workers if the partisan fight fails to yield a deal.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump has reversed course and is purportedly planning to host a bipartisan gathering of the top four US congressional leaders at the White House on Monday afternoon in a last-ditch effort to avoid a looming government shutdown</strong>, the House speaker and the US president’s fellow Republican, Mike Johnson, said on Sunday.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>The <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/25/james-comey-fbi-director-indictment\\\">indictment</a> of former FBI director <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/james-comey\\\">James Comey</a> is part of a concerted effort by <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\\\">Donald Trump</a> to “rewrite history” in his favor</strong>, a former senior White House lawyer claimed on Sunday as he warned of more retribution to come for the president’s political opponents.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>The mayor of <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\\\">New York City</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-adams\\\">Eric Adams</a>, announced on Sunday that he was abandoning his faltering bid to win re-election, just over a month before election day.</strong> Adams, who was trailing in the polls, was elected as a <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\\\">Democrat</a> but ran for re-election as an independent after he was indicted on federal corruption charges, which were <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/eric-adams-corruption-case-dismissed\\\">then dropped</a> by the <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\\\">Trump administration</a> in exchange for his cooperation on immigration raids.</p></li> \\n   <li><p><strong>Children, including the very young, have been spending weeks or months in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention facility in a remote part of Texas where outside monitors have heard accounts of shortages of clean drinking water, chronic sleep deprivation and kids struggling for hygiene supplies and prompt medical attention</strong>, as revealed in a stark new court filing.</p></li> \\n  </ul> \\n </div> \\n <p class=\\\"block-time updated-time\\\">Updated <time datetime=\\\"2025-09-29T10:58:06.490Z\\\">at 11.58am BST</time></p> \\n</div>\",\n        \"excerpt\": \"US president to push Israeli prime minister to agree to new framework to end war in Gaza and free remaining hostages held by Hamas\",\n        \"author\": \"Lucy Campbell (now) Rachel Leingang and Tom Ambrose (earlier)\",\n        \"category\": \"US news\",\n        \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/sep/29/donald-trump-benjamin-netanyahu-gaza-white-house-us-politics-live\",\n        \"image_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8b6c8649e35b49d2fe7de99634765c3b1a3f0e7/1351_0_2223_1779/500.jpg\",\n        \"published_at\": \"2025-09-29T16:46:42.000000Z\",\n        \"source\": {\n            \"id\": 2,\n            \"name\": \"The Guardian\",\n            \"slug\": \"guardian\"\n        },\n        \"created_at\": \"2025-09-29T16:47:21.000000Z\",\n        \"updated_at\": \"2025-09-29T16:47:21.000000Z\"\n    }\n}",

Here is the full text:</p> <ul> <li><p>Gaza will be a de-radicalized terror-free zone that does not pose a threat to its neighbors.</p></li> <li><p>Gaza will be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who have suffered more than enough.</p></li> <li><p>If both sides agree to this proposal, the war will immediately end. Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed upon line to prepare for a hostage release. During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal.</p></li> <li><p>Within 72 hours of Israel publicly accepting this agreement, all hostages, alive and deceased, will be returned.</p></li> <li><p>Once all hostages are released, Israel will release 250 life sentence prisoners plus 1700 Gazans who were detained after Oct. 7, 2023, including all women and children detained in that context. For every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 deceased Gazans.</p></li> <li><p>Once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful coexistence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries.</p></li> <li><p>Upon acceptance of this agreement, full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip. At a minimum, aid quantities will be consistent with what was included in the Jan. 19, 2025, agreement regarding humanitarian aid, including rehabilitation of infrastructure (water, electricity, sewage), rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries, and entry of necessary equipment to remove rubble and open roads.</p></li> <li><p>Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner with either party. Opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under the Jan. 19, 2025 agreement.</p></li> <li><p>Gaza will be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza.</p></li> <li><p>This committee will be made up of qualified Palestinians and international experts, with oversight and supervision by a new international transitional body, the “Board of Peace,” which will be headed and chaired by President Donald J. Trump, with other members and heads of State to be announced, including Former Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p></li> <li><p>This body will set the framework and handle the funding for the redevelopment of Gaza until such time as the Palestinian Authority has completed its reform program, as outlined in various proposals, including President Trump’s peace plan in 2020 and the Saudi-French proposal, and can securely and effectively take back control of Gaza. This body will call on best international standards to create modern and efficient governance that serves the people of Gaza and is conducive to attracting investment.</p></li> <li><p>A Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energize Gaza will be created by convening a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East. Many thoughtful investment proposals and exciting development ideas have been crafted by well-meaning international groups, and will be considered to synthesize the security and governance frameworks to attract and facilitate these investments that will create jobs, opportunity, and hope for future Gaza.</p></li> <li><p>A special economic zone will be established with preferred tariff and access rates to be negotiated with participating countries.</p></li> <li><p>No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return. We will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza.</p></li> <li><p>Hamas and other factions agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form. All military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt. There will be a process of demilitarization of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning, and supported by an internationally funded buy back and reintegration program all verified by the independent monitors. New Gaza will be fully committed to building a prosperous economy and to peaceful coexistence with their neighbors.</p></li> <li><p>A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people.</p></li> <li><p>The United States will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza. The ISF will train and provide support to vetted Palestinian police forces in Gaza, and will consult with Jordan and Egypt who have extensive experience in this field. This force will be the long-term internal security solution. The ISF will work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with newly trained Palestinian police forces. It is critical to prevent munitions from entering Gaza and to facilitate the rapid and secure flow of goods to rebuild and revitalize Gaza. A de-confliction mechanism will be agreed upon by the parties.</p></li> <li><p>Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. As the ISF establishes control and stability, the Israel Defense Forces (I.D.F.) will withdraw based on standards, milestones, and time frames linked to demilitarization that will be agreed upon between the IDF, ISF, the guarantors, and the United States, with the objective of a secure Gaza that no longer poses a threat to Israel, Egypt, or its citizens. Practically, the IDF will progressively hand over the Gaza territory it occupies to the ISF according to an agreement they will make with the transitional authority until they are withdrawn completely from Gaza, save for a security perimeter presence that will remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat.</p></li> <li><p>In the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operation, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF to the ISF.</p></li> <li><p>An interfaith dialogue process will be established based on the values of tolerance and peaceful coexistence to try and change mind-sets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis by emphasizing the benefits that can be derived from peace.</p></li> <li><p>While Gaza redevelopment advances and when the PA reform program is faithfully carried out, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.</p></li> <li><p>The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\\\"block-time updated-time\\\">Updated <time datetime=\\\"2025-09-29T18:51:48.915Z\\\">at 7.51pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\\\"block-68dac8e08f080edbe2663c9e\\\" class=\\\"block is-key-event\\\" data-block-contributor=\\\"\\\"> <p class=\\\"block-time published-time\\\"> <time datetime=\\\"2025-09-29T18:02:02.069Z\\\">7.02pm <span class=\\\"timezone\\\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\\\"block-title\\\">Netanyahu 'expressed deep regret' that Israeli strike on Doha killed Qatari serviceman, says White House</h2>  <div class=\\\"block-elements\\\">  <p>Here is the White House’s readout confirming the trilateral call reported earlier during which Benjamin Netanyahu <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/sep/29/donald-trump-benjamin-netanyahu-gaza-white-house-us-politics-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68dabc688f08206a90f0905c#block-68dabc688f08206a90f0905c\\\">apologized to Qatari PM</a> Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani over Israel’s strikes on Doha earlier this month.</p> <blockquote class=\\\"quoted\\\"> <p>Today, President Donald J.

But it’s peace in the Middle East,” he said.</p> <p>In other developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>More than 100,000 federal workers are to formally resign on Tuesday, the largest such mass event in US history, as part of a <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\\\">Trump administration</a> program designed to make sweeping cuts to the federal workforce.</strong> With Congress facing a deadline of Tuesday to authorize more funding or spark a <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/27/government-shutdown-explainer\\\">government shutdown</a>, the White House has also ordered federal agencies to draw up plans for large-scale firings of workers if the partisan fight fails to yield a deal.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Donald Trump has reversed course and is purportedly planning to host a bipartisan gathering of the top four US congressional leaders at the White House on Monday afternoon in a last-ditch effort to avoid a looming government shutdown</strong>, the House speaker and the US president’s fellow Republican, Mike Johnson, said on Sunday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/25/james-comey-fbi-director-indictment\\\">indictment</a> of former FBI director <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/james-comey\\\">James Comey</a> is part of a concerted effort by <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\\\">Donald Trump</a> to “rewrite history” in his favor</strong>, a former senior White House lawyer claimed on Sunday as he warned of more retribution to come for the president’s political opponents.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The mayor of <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\\\">New York City</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-adams\\\">Eric Adams</a>, announced on Sunday that he was abandoning his faltering bid to win re-election, just over a month before election day.</strong> Adams, who was trailing in the polls, was elected as a <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\\\">Democrat</a> but ran for re-election as an independent after he was indicted on federal corruption charges, which were <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/eric-adams-corruption-case-dismissed\\\">then dropped</a> by the <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\\\">Trump administration</a> in exchange for his cooperation on immigration raids.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Children, including the very young, have been spending weeks or months in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention facility in a remote part of Texas where outside monitors have heard accounts of shortages of clean drinking water, chronic sleep deprivation and kids struggling for hygiene supplies and prompt medical attention</strong>, as revealed in a stark new court filing.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\\\"block-time updated-time\\\">Updated <time datetime=\\\"2025-09-29T10:58:06.490Z\\\">at 11.58am BST</time></p>  </div>\",\n            \"excerpt\": \"Netanyahu says he supports Trump’s Gaza peace plan but Hamas still must agree to proposal\",\n            \"author\": \"Lois Beckett (now); Lucy Campbell, Rachel Leingang and Tom Ambrose (earlier)\",\n            \"category\": \"US news\",\n            \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/sep/29/donald-trump-benjamin-netanyahu-gaza-white-house-us-politics-live\",\n            \"image_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6855d1ff0f1594a3d9aba5cbb5ee09ac76df1ca/473_0_3985_3188/500.jpg\",\n            \"published_at\": \"2025-09-29T21:00:03.000000Z\",\n            \"source\": {\n                \"id\": 2,\n                \"name\": \"The Guardian\",\n                \"slug\": \"guardian\"\n            },\n            \"created_at\": \"2025-09-29T16:47:21.000000Z\",\n            \"updated_at\": \"2025-09-29T21:10:07.000000Z\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"meta\": {\n        \"current_page\": 1,\n        \"last_page\": 1,\n        \"per_page\": 15,\n        \"total\": 1\n    }\n}",

Here is the full text:</p> <ul> <li><p>Gaza will be a de-radicalized terror-free zone that does not pose a threat to its neighbors.</p></li> <li><p>Gaza will be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who have suffered more than enough.</p></li> <li><p>If both sides agree to this proposal, the war will immediately end. Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed upon line to prepare for a hostage release. During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal.</p></li> <li><p>Within 72 hours of Israel publicly accepting this agreement, all hostages, alive and deceased, will be returned.</p></li> <li><p>Once all hostages are released, Israel will release 250 life sentence prisoners plus 1700 Gazans who were detained after Oct. 7, 2023, including all women and children detained in that context. For every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 deceased Gazans.</p></li> <li><p>Once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful coexistence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries.</p></li> <li><p>Upon acceptance of this agreement, full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip. At a minimum, aid quantities will be consistent with what was included in the Jan. 19, 2025, agreement regarding humanitarian aid, including rehabilitation of infrastructure (water, electricity, sewage), rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries, and entry of necessary equipment to remove rubble and open roads.</p></li> <li><p>Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner with either party. Opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under the Jan. 19, 2025 agreement.</p></li> <li><p>Gaza will be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza.</p></li> <li><p>This committee will be made up of qualified Palestinians and international experts, with oversight and supervision by a new international transitional body, the “Board of Peace,” which will be headed and chaired by President Donald J. Trump, with other members and heads of State to be announced, including Former Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p></li> <li><p>This body will set the framework and handle the funding for the redevelopment of Gaza until such time as the Palestinian Authority has completed its reform program, as outlined in various proposals, including President Trump’s peace plan in 2020 and the Saudi-French proposal, and can securely and effectively take back control of Gaza. This body will call on best international standards to create modern and efficient governance that serves the people of Gaza and is conducive to attracting investment.</p></li> <li><p>A Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energize Gaza will be created by convening a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East. Many thoughtful investment proposals and exciting development ideas have been crafted by well-meaning international groups, and will be considered to synthesize the security and governance frameworks to attract and facilitate these investments that will create jobs, opportunity, and hope for future Gaza.</p></li> <li><p>A special economic zone will be established with preferred tariff and access rates to be negotiated with participating countries.</p></li> <li><p>No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return. We will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza.</p></li> <li><p>Hamas and other factions agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form. All military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt. There will be a process of demilitarization of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning, and supported by an internationally funded buy back and reintegration program all verified by the independent monitors. New Gaza will be fully committed to building a prosperous economy and to peaceful coexistence with their neighbors.</p></li> <li><p>A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people.</p></li> <li><p>The United States will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza. The ISF will train and provide support to vetted Palestinian police forces in Gaza, and will consult with Jordan and Egypt who have extensive experience in this field. This force will be the long-term internal security solution. The ISF will work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with newly trained Palestinian police forces. It is critical to prevent munitions from entering Gaza and to facilitate the rapid and secure flow of goods to rebuild and revitalize Gaza. A de-confliction mechanism will be agreed upon by the parties.</p></li> <li><p>Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. As the ISF establishes control and stability, the Israel Defense Forces (I.D.F.) will withdraw based on standards, milestones, and time frames linked to demilitarization that will be agreed upon between the IDF, ISF, the guarantors, and the United States, with the objective of a secure Gaza that no longer poses a threat to Israel, Egypt, or its citizens. Practically, the IDF will progressively hand over the Gaza territory it occupies to the ISF according to an agreement they will make with the transitional authority until they are withdrawn completely from Gaza, save for a security perimeter presence that will remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat.</p></li> <li><p>In the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operation, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF to the ISF.</p></li> <li><p>An interfaith dialogue process will be established based on the values of tolerance and peaceful coexistence to try and change mind-sets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis by emphasizing the benefits that can be derived from peace.</p></li> <li><p>While Gaza redevelopment advances and when the PA reform program is faithfully carried out, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.</p></li> <li><p>The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\\\"block-time updated-time\\\">Updated <time datetime=\\\"2025-09-29T18:51:48.915Z\\\">at 7.51pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\\\"block-68dac8e08f080edbe2663c9e\\\" class=\\\"block is-key-event\\\" data-block-contributor=\\\"\\\"> <p class=\\\"block-time published-time\\\"> <time datetime=\\\"2025-09-29T18:02:02.069Z\\\">7.02pm <span class=\\\"timezone\\\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\\\"block-title\\\">Netanyahu 'expressed deep regret' that Israeli strike on Doha killed Qatari serviceman, says White House</h2>  <div class=\\\"block-elements\\\">  <p>Here is the White House’s readout confirming the trilateral call reported earlier during which Benjamin Netanyahu <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/sep/29/donald-trump-benjamin-netanyahu-gaza-white-house-us-politics-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68dabc688f08206a90f0905c#block-68dabc688f08206a90f0905c\\\">apologized to Qatari PM</a> Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani over Israel’s strikes on Doha earlier this month.</p> <blockquote class=\\\"quoted\\\"> <p>Today, President Donald J.

But it’s peace in the Middle East,” he said.</p> <p>In other developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>More than 100,000 federal workers are to formally resign on Tuesday, the largest such mass event in US history, as part of a <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\\\">Trump administration</a> program designed to make sweeping cuts to the federal workforce.</strong> With Congress facing a deadline of Tuesday to authorize more funding or spark a <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/27/government-shutdown-explainer\\\">government shutdown</a>, the White House has also ordered federal agencies to draw up plans for large-scale firings of workers if the partisan fight fails to yield a deal.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Donald Trump has reversed course and is purportedly planning to host a bipartisan gathering of the top four US congressional leaders at the White House on Monday afternoon in a last-ditch effort to avoid a looming government shutdown</strong>, the House speaker and the US president’s fellow Republican, Mike Johnson, said on Sunday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/25/james-comey-fbi-director-indictment\\\">indictment</a> of former FBI director <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/james-comey\\\">James Comey</a> is part of a concerted effort by <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\\\">Donald Trump</a> to “rewrite history” in his favor</strong>, a former senior White House lawyer claimed on Sunday as he warned of more retribution to come for the president’s political opponents.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The mayor of <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\\\">New York City</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-adams\\\">Eric Adams</a>, announced on Sunday that he was abandoning his faltering bid to win re-election, just over a month before election day.</strong> Adams, who was trailing in the polls, was elected as a <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\\\">Democrat</a> but ran for re-election as an independent after he was indicted on federal corruption charges, which were <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/eric-adams-corruption-case-dismissed\\\">then dropped</a> by the <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\\\">Trump administration</a> in exchange for his cooperation on immigration raids.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Children, including the very young, have been spending weeks or months in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention facility in a remote part of Texas where outside monitors have heard accounts of shortages of clean drinking water, chronic sleep deprivation and kids struggling for hygiene supplies and prompt medical attention</strong>, as revealed in a stark new court filing.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\\\"block-time updated-time\\\">Updated <time datetime=\\\"2025-09-29T10:58:06.490Z\\\">at 11.58am BST</time></p>  </div>\",\n            \"excerpt\": \"Netanyahu says he supports Trump’s Gaza peace plan but Hamas still must agree to proposal\",\n            \"author\": \"Lois Beckett (now);

The concentrated bloodletting, spread out across four states, took the lives of nine people, including the suspect in Sunday’s shooting at Grand Blanc’s Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints church, as well as injuring at least 33.</p> <p>The weekend’s spate brings the archive’s <a href=\\\"https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/\\\">tally</a> of mass shootings – defined as events with at least four victims injured or killed, not counting the shooter – to 324 this year alone, as of Monday morning. That is a rate of more than one a day.</p> <p>The weekend’s carnage began in the early hours of Saturday morning when multiple shots were fired in separate incidents in Alexandria, Louisiana, and in Raleigh, North Carolina. At least four people were injured on <a href=\\\"https://www.kalb.com/2025/09/27/rpso-multiple-people-shot-hwy-71-saturday-morning/\\\">Highway 71 South</a> in Alexandria.</p> <p>At about the same time, 4am local time, four people were shot and injured on <a href=\\\"https://www.wral.com/news/local/hookah-millbrook-shooting-sept-2025/\\\">Millbrook Road in Raleigh</a>. Three of the hurt individuals were found at the scene of the gunfire, and a fourth presented later at hospital.</p> <p>Saturday’s third mass shooting broke out at about 9.30pm when a gunman armed with a semi-automatic, short-barreled rifle opened fire from a boat on a waterfront bar in <a href=\\\"https://www.wyff4.com/article/north-carolina-restaurant-shooting-gunman-boat/68097548\\\">Southport, North Carolina</a>. The shooting left three people dead and eight injured.</p>    <p>Local news reporters said the target had been the American Fish Company. The suspect fled by boat but was arrested by the US Coast Guard and has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder and other felonies.</p> <p>Then, just before midnight on Saturday, a 34-year-old gunman opened fire at <a href=\\\"https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2025/09/28/2-killed-several-injured-in-shooting-at-kickapoo-lucky-eagle-casino-maverick-county-judge-says/\\\">Kickapoo Lucky Eagle Casino</a> along the border with Mexico in Texas. The gambling spot was packed at the time with customers at a raffle event.</p> <p>One person was pronounced dead at the casino and a second died on the way to hospital. One of those killed was a retired US Customs and Border Protection officer, the mayor of Eagle Pass said on social media.</p> <p>The suspected shooter has been charged with two counts of murder carrying the possibility of the death penalty.</p> <p>The intense burst of mass shootings underlines America’s crisis of gun violence fueled by the country’s unique relationship with firearms. There are almost <a href=\\\"https://www.thetrace.org/2023/03/guns-america-data-atf-total/\\\">400m guns</a> in circulation in the US – far more than in any other wealthy country.</p> <p>Mass shootings are just the thin end of a very thick wedge. Though they are among the most heavily reported and terror-inducing cases, the scourge of gun deaths extends far wider than that.</p> <p>In 2023, the last year for which official figures are given, nearly 47,000 people died by the gun in the US, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It was the third-highest year on record, after a Covid pandemic-induced spike through the previous two years.</p> <p>The weekend’s devastating run of mass shootings carried into Sunday. At about 2.22am, shots rang out when a fight appeared to break out on <a href=\\\"https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/crime/1-killed-3-injured-in-bourbon-street-shooting-nopd-says-crime-new-orleans-police-investigation-shooting-gun-violence/289-f8160f83-4b28-497b-a714-8a30e6be45e0\\\">Bourbon Street</a>, the famous tourist destination in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana. Four people were struck, including a woman who died at the scene, police said.</p> <p>New Orleans police superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said the woman who died was a 33-year-old bystander celebrating her birthday from Chicago. Among the injured victims was the woman’s sibling.</p> <p>Kirkpatrick pointed to the laxity of Louisiana’s gun laws as a factor in the disaster. The state requires no permit to openly carry a firearm.</p> <p>“We recognize the legality of being able to carry a gun, but when you mix it with people who have been drinking, then we have a high-risk situation,’” she said. “Please, leave your guns at home.”</p> <p>The last of the six mass shootings was the catastrophe <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/29/mormon-church-shooting-trump-sign\\\">in Michigan</a>, where the attacker rammed open the front door of the church using a silver pickup truck bearing two American flags.

It’s handing our hard-earned tax dollars over to the owners of coal plants that cost more to run than new, clean energy,” said Amanda Levin, director of policy analysis at the national environmental non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council. “This is a colossal waste of our money at a time when the federal government should be spurring along the new energy sources that can power the AI boom and help bring down electricity bills for struggling families.”</p> <p>The administration’s new $625m investment includes $350m to “modernize” coal plants, $175m for coal projects it claims will provide affordable and reliable energy to rural communities, and $50m to upgrade wastewater management systems to extend the lifespan of coal plants.</p> <p>The efforts follow previous coal-focused initiatives from the Trump administration, which has greenlit mining leases while fast-tracking mining permits. It has also <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/20/trump-michigan-coal-power-plants\\\">prolonged the life of some coal plants</a>, exempted <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/epa-trump-email-fossil-fuel-exemptions\\\">some coal plants</a> from EPA rules, and <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/09/trump-epa-power-plant-emissions\\\">falsely claimed</a> that emissions from those plants are “not significant”.</p> <p>The moves have sparked outrage from environmental advocates who <a href=\\\"https://www.nrdc.org/bio/christy-walsh/trumps-attempts-bring-back-coal-will-fail\\\">note that</a> coal pollution has been linked to hundreds of thousands of deaths across the past two decades.

Lor spent three years behind bars after being convicted of property, drug and weapons crimes when he was 21. The operation was the latest in a wave of deportation flights that have roiled south-east Asian enclaves in the midwest and across the country.</p> <p>Since Donald Trump took office for a second time, forced removals of south-east Asians with criminal records have soared. In a single flight over Memorial Day weekend, Ice deported 93 Vietnamese and 65 Laotian nationals, according to Vo Danh, a collective of organizers advocating for the abolition of Ice. The Lao Embassy said that it has issued <a href=\\\"https://www.startribune.com/hmong-minnesotans-face-deportation-laos-ice-arrests/601385285\\\">145 people travel papers</a> for deportation since January – a more than tenfold increase from previous years.</p> <p>In the Twin Cities, home to the largest Hmong population outside of the US, immigrant advocates have been protesting and pushing hard for immigration reform, as more than 150 south-east Asians in Minnesota have been deported since May.</p> <p>Kaohly Vang Her, a state representative, said she’s been discussing with Tim Walz, the governor, and Keith Ellison, the attorney general, about expediting the state pardon process, which can shield people from deportation by vacating their convictions.</p> <p>The approach yielded some success in New York, as the governor Kathy Hochul pardoned a Lao refugee in early July to spare him from deportation, following a yearslong campaign from grassroots organizers.</p> <p>Besides expediting the pardon process, Her said there are unfortunately few other levers that state legislators can pull. She’s instead focusing on informing her constituents about relevant immigration news, such as which Minnesota counties have agreements with Ice.</p>    <p>Many formerly incarcerated south-east Asians who are facing deportation, Her said, have long reformed and raised families. They work and pay taxes.</p> <p>Ripping away breadwinners from families, Her said, creates “a ripple effect that will be really challenging to overcome”. Mothers and grandparents might have to apply for public assistance, she said, and a new generation of children could grow up with trauma.</p> <p>South-east Asians are <a href=\\\"https://searac.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SEAA-School-to-Deportation-Pipeline_0.pdfhttps://searac.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SEAA-School-to-Deportation-Pipeline_0.pdf\\\">three to five times more likely</a> to be deported than other immigrant groups due to a prior conviction, which can strip someone’s legal permanent resident status. The administration’s targeting of south-east Asians with old convictions, community advocates say, is creating yet another cycle of trauma and displacement for a group that’s suffered under generations of US foreign policy.</p> <p>“We see these deportations as a betrayal of US duty to refugees,” said Quyen Dinh, executive director of the Southeast Asian Resource Center. “When you accept a refugee, you don’t accept them for just three to five years, you accept them for their entire lifetime.”</p> <p>Since the fall of Saigon in 1975, more than 1.2 million refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos have settled in the US, forming the country’s largest refugee diaspora. Thousands of Hmong, fearing retaliation for their alliance with the US in the secret war, fled to refugee camps in Thailand before also making their way to America.</p> <p>Many south-east Asians settled in low-income communities – including Long Beach and Stockton, California, and St Paul, Minnesota – with substandard housing and low-paying jobs, and few resources to treat lingering war trauma. Due to a lack of effective refugee resettlement programs in the 1980s and 1990s, Dihn said, many young people ended up joining gangs and committing crimes of poverty. Xiao said Lor was one example of this – that he had fallen in with a tough crowd after resettling in the US as a teenager who barely understood English.</p> <p>More than 3 million people of south-east Asian descent reside in the US today, <a href=\\\"https://searac.org/news/capac-discusses-alarming-rise-of-southeast-asian-deportations-under-trump/\\\">17,000 of whom have removal orders</a> largely tied to past convictions. More than 2,000 have been deported.</p> <p>What helped paved the way for this, Dinh said, was the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which expanded the crimes that made immigrants eligible for deportation. It also made it harder for undocumented immigrants to gain legal status. Before the law was enacted, Dinh said, permanent residents and refugees who committed a crime would not be automatically deported, and would be given the right to plead their cases of transformation.</p> <p>This year, deportations have accelerated as the Trump administration threatened sanctions to pressure Laos, which doesn’t have a formal repatriation agreement with the US, to take back deportees. Many immigration advocates are expecting the raids to ramp up after the supreme court lifted an order on 8 September that barred the administration from stopping people solely based on their race, language or job.</p> <p>Tin Thanh Nguyen, a North Carolina-based immigration attorney, is representing <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/02/lawyers-say-men-deported-by-us-to-eswatini-are-being-imprisoned-illegally\\\">two refugees from Vietnam and Laos</a> who were flown in July to a maximum security prison in southern Africa. The men, aged 34 and 45, arrived in the US when they were children, Nguyen said. Both had served time for criminal offenses they committed as teenagers.</p> <p>Nguyen said formerly incarcerated south-east Asians are easy targets for mass deportation because their information is already in the system as they attend annual Ice check-ins.</p> <p>“They’re low-lying fruit,” Nguyen said. “They have final orders of removal and they’ve been checking in with Ice for years.”</p> <p>In previous years, Nguyen said he was helping people fight those removal orders. The Trump administration is removing so many people so quickly that the strategy is no longer viable, he said. His focus now is helping detainees obtain travel documents so they can be sent to their homeland and not a third country.</p> <p>Thao Ha, the executive director of the non-profit Collective Freedom, said new deportees to Laos need help securing safe housing, employment and citizenship. Loved ones in the US have turned to GoFundMe to raise money for food, clothing and basic necessities.</p> <p>For those with final removal orders, Ha said, the cruelty of the process itself is often more frightening than the prospect of restarting their lives in another country.</p> <p>“They’ve accepted that deportation is their fate,” she said. “But why does it have to be this way, the sudden detention, sudden snatching away without warning?”</p> <p>Kua Yang had been a free man for only a year and a half when he was deported to Laos, a country he had never been to.</p> <p>Yang, 47, was born in a refugee camp in Thailand and resettled with his family in Stockton, California. At 16, he received a life sentence for gang-related armed robbery. In 2023, after serving 28 years in prison, he was released on parole and reconnected with his mother and two sisters, who he hadn’t seen since they were infants. He taught their daughters how to read and write.</p> <p>Then, in March, the crime for which Yang spent half a lifetime repenting sent him to a foreign homeland. In Vientiane, the sweltering Laotian capital, he saw widespread despair.</p> <p>“Some people miss their kids so much,” he said. “They just stay in their rooms and drink.”</p> <p>So Yang and two other deportees partnered with Collective Freedom to help new deportees readjust and find housing. They deliver care packages, hygiene items, food and cash to anyone who needs it. He’s working on establishing a transitional home with job training workshops. During the week, he teaches English to Lao citizens.</p> <p>“Helping others gave me a purpose,” he said. “When I first came here I thought, ‘What am I going to do in this land?’ Now, I’d say I believe in a life here.”</p>\",\n            \"excerpt\": \"Administration’s targeting of group settled in the US after fleeing war in Vietnam creating further displacement\",\n            \"author\": \"Claire Wang\",\n            \"category\": \"US news\",\n            \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/29/ice-deportation-south-east-asians-vietnam-war\",\n            \"image_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/50b85c3da0b9aab2052e876ded97895d421b0498/690_0_6869_5499/500.jpg\",\n            \"published_at\": \"2025-09-29T15:00:32.000000Z\",\n            \"source\": {\n                \"id\": 2,\n                \"name\": \"The Guardian\",\n                \"slug\": \"guardian\"\n            },\n            \"created_at\": \"2025-09-29T16:47:21.000000Z\",\n            \"updated_at\": \"2025-09-29T16:47:21.000000Z\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 99,\n            \"title\": \"Michigan car crash kills three family members from TLC’s Meet the Putmans\",\n            \"content\": \"<p>Three members of the <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michigan\\\">Michigan</a>-based family featured on TLC’s reality show Meet the Putmans were recently killed in a car crash, and five other members were injured.</p> <p>In a <a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DPG5kTDDqxx/\\\">statement</a> shared on Saturday, the family said its patriarch Bill “Papa” Putman, his wife, Barb – who goes by Neenee – and their daughter-in-law Megan were killed in a “tragic car accident” that was evidently reported the previous night.</p> <p>“They have gone home to be with the Lord,” the statement added.</p> <p>The family added that members identified&nbsp;as Uncle Blake, Lulu, Alena, Noah and Gia were also injured in the crash and remained hospitalized.</p> <p>“We are asking for complete healing and strength for each of them,” they said.

The Pew Research Center’s most recent <a href=\\\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/\\\">religious landscape study</a> estimates that about 1% of the US population, or about 2.6 million people identify with the Synod, putting the denomination at approximately half the size of the ELCA.</p> <p>The revelations about Eidsmoe, whose links to neo-Confederate organizations have previously ignited scandal for high profile Republican politicians, are just the most recent in a series of connections between LCMS and far-right and white supremacist individuals which have roiled the congregation since 2023.</p> <p>In a telephone call, Eidsmoe confirmed that he was an ordained Lutheran minister currently serving a Presbyterian congregation in Alabama. Asked if he was a neo-Confederate, Eidsmoe said “no, I would not,” however: “I believe that there are some good values in southern culture, and I believe that the South had a constitutional right to secede.”</p> <p>Eidsmoe also denied any direct links to LCMS, saying: “I wouldn’t say there’s really any relationship with the Missouri Synod. I did speak once for Lutheran Classical College but only as a guest speaker and I’m on the board of Lutherans for Life, which is not a Missouri Synod organization it’s pan-Lutheran.”</p> <p>When the Guardian pointed out that Lutherans for Life is a Registered Service Organization of LCMS, he said: “Well yes, but I mean a lot of organizations that are not Missouri Synod are nevertheless licensed in that way.”</p> <p>In response to an email requesting comment, the Rev Roy S Askins, LCMS managing director of editorial and theological content, wrote: “Col. John Eidsmoe is not an LCMS pastor nor a member of any LCMS congregation.”</p> <p>He did not respond to a further request to clarify Eidsmoe’s involvement in LCMS-aligned organizations.</p> <p>Hours after the request was sent, LCMS president Matthew Harrison posted a long message to Facebook which in part read: “A few on our far edges say untoward things about race, failing to take into account the beautiful message of the N.T. that “God is no respecter of persons.” (Acts 10) And that repeatedly in the N.T. we see lists of early Christians which include multiple ethnicities from around the Mediterranean world.”</p> <p>Joshua Salzberg is a member of an LCMS church, and co-founder of Lutherans for Racial Justice, which has been critical of the congregation’s approach to racial issues, and the presence of far-right figures connected to LCMS.</p> <p>Salzburg said: “When neo-Confederate figures go unchecked in LCMS spaces, it opens the door for more far right voices to gain influence.</p> <p>Salzberg added: “My hope is that there would be at least as much energy for reckoning with Neo-confederate views that contradict the teachings of The LCMS as there is for other views that brush up against the Synod’s doctrine.”.</p> <p>Jeff Tischauser, a senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), said of the CCC: “While the group’s influence is waning, and while its influence even within the white power movement is minimal, the CCC can still attract violent racists who the group further radicalizes, as shown with Dylann Roof. So just because it’s fractured and the influence isn’t there doesn’t mean that it’s not dangerous because of the content that it produces.”</p> <h2>Eidsmoe’s LCMS connections</h2> <p>Eidsmoe, a retired colonel of both the USAF and the Mississippi state guard according to his online biographies, is an ordained pastor who <a href=\\\"https://woodlandpca.org/our-pastor/\\\">currently serves a Presbyterian church</a> in Notasulga, Alabama.</p> <p>But Eidsmoe is or has been affiliated with several organizations which are directly affiliated with the LCMS, or who have sought affiliation from the organization.</p> <p>According to the website of anti-abortion group <a href=\\\"https://lutheransforlife.org/bod/col-john-eidsmoe-pike-road-alabama/\\\">Lutherans for Life</a>, which is a Recognized Service Organization (RSO) of LCMS, Eidsmoe is a board member. The <a href=\\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201021194626/https://lutheransforlife.org/bod/col-john-eidsmoe-pike-road-alabama/\\\">earliest Internet Archive snapshot</a> of his biography page is from 2020, indicating that he has been on the board for at least five years.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\\\"https://www.lcms.org/how-we-serve/mercy/recognized-service-organizations\\\">LCMS website</a>, RSOs are “not-for-profit organizations that are independent” of LCMS, but “operate ministry programs that foster the mission and ministry of the church”. RSO affiliation is subject to LCMS approval.</p> <p>Just weeks ago, Eidsmoe <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgANBsm3rE0\\\">spoke at Luther Classical College’s Christian Culture Conference</a> at the college’s campus in Casper, Wyoming. That college was founded by LCMS clergy and laity. It is not formally associated with LCMS, but it did make a rejected application to become a Recognized Service Organization.</p> <p>Eidsmoe was also <a href=\\\"https://ilt.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2018-2019-Academic-Catalog.pdf\\\">listed in 2018-2019</a> as an adjunct professor of pastoral theology at the Institute of Lutheran Theology – he is listed in the 2022 academic catalog – whose founders <a href=\\\"https://www.adcrucem.news/p/lutheran-institute-of-theology-aims\\\">describe it as “an unprecedented venture within the LCMS”</a>. Despite this claim, the LCMS <a href=\\\"https://reporter.lcms.org/2025/lcms-addresses-unauthorized-non-lcms-pastoral-formation-programs/\\\">warned its members</a> in May against enrolling in an “unauthorized” online pastoral formation course.</p> <p>Eidsmoe has Lutheran links beyond the LCMS. He is also listed as a past conference speaker by the <a href=\\\"https://apologeticscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/About-CAW-2025-Conference.pdf\\\">Center for Apologetics and Worldviews</a> (CAW). CAW is not directly affiliated with LCMS but with the Evangelical Lutheran Synod, a separate, much smaller Lutheran denomination that shares similar conservative commitments to LCMS.</p> <h2>Neo-Confederate connections</h2> <p>Along with LCMS links, Eidsmoe also has long-standing links to the neo-Confederate movement, which describes a variety of organizations and activists who at best offer revisionist accounts of the south’s efforts to preserve slavery by seceding from the US, and at worst argue for the restoration or secession of a segregated, white supremacist Confederacy.</p> <p>These connections have drawn national coverage in the past due to Eidsmoe’s connections to high-profile Republican politicians including Roy Moore and Michele Bachmann.</p> <p>According to the organization’s website, Eidsmoe still serves as <a href=\\\"https://www.morallaw.org/our-staff\\\">senior counsel at the Foundation for Moral Law</a>, founded by failed senate candidate Roy Moore.</p> <p>Moore’s chaotic bid to become senator for Alabama after previous incumbent Jeff Sessions entered the first Trump administration failed <a href=\\\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42054780\\\">amid accusations that he had sexually abused a 14 year-old girl</a> when he was a 32 year-old prosecutor in the late 1970s. Moore denied those allegations, but lost the special election.</p> <p>But his association with Eidsmoe also drew critical reporting at that time.</p> <p>During his run, CNN <a href=\\\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/27/politics/kfile-roy-moore-secession-day-events\\\">reported on a “Secession Day” event</a> held at the premises of the Moore’s Moral Law Foundation in which Eidsmoe was a prominent participant.</p> <p>According to CNN, video of the event showed “Alabama’s 1861 secession flag and a banner ‘in memory of the men in gray’ who fought to maintain ‘the principles of the Constitution’ in the Civil War.”</p> <p>The report continued: “Among those in the video was John Eidsmoe, who was hired to join the foundation’s legal team in 2008 and is still listed on its website as the senior counsel and resident scholar.”</p> <p>Earlier, during the rise of the Tea Party movement, associations with Eidsmoe troubled both Moore, who made a run as a Tea Party candidate for Alabama governor in 2010, and Michele Bachmann, who was the most visible Tea Party affiliate in Congress where she served between 2007 and 2015.</p> <p>In 2010, Eidsmoe pulled out from speaking at a Tea Party event in Wausau, Wisconsin, after reporters unearthed his record of his <a href=\\\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/hatewatch/anti-lgbt-rally-montgomery-draws-strong-rhetoric-and-league-south-0/\\\">previous speeches</a> hosted by the neo-Confederate organizations the League of the South and the Council of Concerned Citizens.</p> <p><a href=\\\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/league-south/\\\">The League of the South</a>, founded in 1994, advocates for a return to white supremacist rule in a secessionist south. The CCC is a white nationalist group formed in 1985, which according to the Southern Poverty Law Center is a descendant of the white citizens councils that were formed to resist school desegregation in the 1950s and 1960s.</p> <p>The two organizations have made common cause in protests against the <a href=\\\"https://www.adl.org/resources/news/council-conservative-citizens-declining-bastion-hate\\\">removal of Confederate monuments</a>. For the League of the South this culminated in their participation in 2017’s deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p> <p>The CCC’s propaganda about race and crime <a href=\\\"https://www.learningforjustice.org/magazine/fall-2017/the-miseducation-of-dylann-roof\\\">informed Dylann Roof’s radicalization</a>. In 2011, Eidsmoe was cited in media reports as a formative influence on Republican politician Michele Bachmann, for whom she worked as a research assistant while she was a student and he a professor at the fundamentalist Oral Roberts University. He was described as Bachmann’s “<a href=\\\"https://newrepublic.com/article/93333/michelle-bachmanns-intellectual-worldview\\\">law school mentor</a>”. <a href=\\\"https://www.npr.org/2011/08/09/139084313/the-books-and-beliefs-shaping-michele-bachmann\\\">Reportedly</a>, Eidsmoe influenced Bachmann’s belief that “American law should be based on the Bible.”</p> <p>These national scandals did not dissuade Eidsmoe of his radical rightwing beliefs.</p> <p>In 2019, he penned a <a href=\\\"https://www.abbevilleinstitute.org/a-copperhead-loves-the-south/\\\">lengthy essay</a> for the neo-Confederate Abbeville Institute, in which he ran through a number of familiar revisionist talking points on the US civil war, claiming that slavery was not the main or only reason for secession, praised confederate president Jefferson Davis and pro-slavery politician and writer John C Calhoun.</p> <p>He wrote: “We object to judging the South on slavery alone, when there was so much good about the South as well. And those good things are what soldiers fought and died for.”</p> <p>The central argument of the essay was against the removal of Confederate statues from public places, writing at one point: “Behind the drive to remove flags and monuments is a drive to re-write history itself, as a prerequisite to fashioning a new America that bears no resemblance to the constitutional republic our Founding Fathers designed.”</p> <h2>LCMS controversies</h2> <p>The Eidsmoe connection is just the most recent intrusion of far-right politics into a denomination that has historically held politics at arms length.</p> <p>Just last week, the <a href=\\\"https://www.alreporter.com/2025/09/04/lutheran-church-in-ozark-hosts-neo-confederate-group/\\\">Alabama Political Reporter revealed</a> that an LCMS church, the Prince of Peace Lutheran Church in Ozark Alabama, has allowed the neo-Confederate group the Southern Cultural Center (SCC) to hold monthly meetings at their facilities for members in that region.</p> <p>In August, the SCC Ozark meeting hosted Eric Orwoll as a guest speaker. Orwoll is the driving force behind the effort to establish Return to the Land, a <a href=\\\"https://www.wired.com/story/whites-only-community-arkansas/\\\">whites-only housing development</a> in Arkansas.</p> <p>Previously, SCC guest speakers have reportedly included <a href=\\\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/john-weaver/\\\">neo-Confederate pastor John Weaver</a> and the <a href=\\\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/jared-taylor/\\\">white nationalist founder of American Renaissance,</a> Jared Taylor.</p> <p>Historically, the LCMS has maintained a doctrinally and scripturally more conservative position than the mainline ELCA, but in contrast to some other evangelical groups they have largely steered clear of involvement in partisan politics or religiously-inflected culture wars.</p> <p>In recent years, however, LCMS has been repeatedly roiled by controversies driven by members of the denomination with connections to far-right groups.</p> <p>In 2023, the denomination drew national attention after it became a focus of far-right organizing.</p> <p>First, white nationalist Corey Mahler targeted the LCMS in his <a href=\\\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/lutheran-church-white-nationalism-rejection-1234690317/\\\">attempts to lead an “influx of hardline young men”</a> into LCMS churches, reportedly promising: “The Millennials who will replace the feckless, spineless, degenerate boomers will be sure to settle accounts and amend the errors of the past century” and that “very soon, we will expel the liberals”.</p> <p>Mahler had been <a href=\\\"https://archive.ph/e01XU\\\">identified by antifascist researchers Machaira Action</a> as a leading light in what they called a “Lutefash” tendency in the Lutheran Church.</p> <p>Mahler was excommunicated from his Lutheran church in Knoxville, Tennessee, that year.</p> <p>Ryan Turnipseed, was also identified by Machaira Action as a member of the “Lutefash” tendency. He was excommunicated in May 2024 by First Lutheran church in his home city of Ponca City, Oklahoma, after a viral 2023 Twitter thread criticizing the LCMS’s new catechism, alleging that it incorporated too many “woke” liberal positions. The move had briefly made him a cause celebre for the online far right.</p> <p>Soon after, the president of the Lutheran church-Missouri synod <a href=\\\"https://ministrywatch.com/lutheran-church-missouri-synod-president-calls-for-excommunicating-white-nationalists/\\\">called for</a> the excommunication of those “propagating radical and unchristian ‘alt-right’ views”.</p> <p>However, weeks after Turnipseed’s excommunication, the LCMS church Immanuel Lutheran of Wichita, Kansas, <a href=\\\"https://evangelicaldarkweb.org/2024/05/28/lcms-whistleblower-excommunication-defied-by-member-church/\\\">undermined the ban</a> by accepting Turnipseed into membership.</p> <p>In July, the Guardian <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/05/far-right-mens-clubs-old-glory\\\">reported</a> that Turnipseed is a leading member of the antisemitic, Christian Nationalist, men-only Old Glory Club, whose network of nationwide lodges is designed to provide in-person meetups and conferences for far-right activists.</p> <p>Salzberger, the racial justice activist, wrote: “As a grassroots organization, Lutherans for Racial Justice hopes to help educate the church on these topics, so that we’re better prepared to recognize white supremacist ideology in all its forms.”</p>\",\n            \"excerpt\": \"John Eidsmoe, associated with Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, has history with public defenses of Confederacy\",\n            \"author\": \"Jason Wilson\",\n            \"category\": \"US news\",\n            \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/29/pastor-john-eidsmoe-lutheran-lutheran-church-missouri-synod-neo-confederate\",\n            \"image_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b5a4e3aa78fd4dd41a011107c7d3a2b760effcf/106_2456_2964_2372/500.jpg\",\n            \"published_at\": \"2025-09-29T11:00:27.000000Z\",\n            \"source\": {\n                \"id\": 2,\n                \"name\": \"The Guardian\",\n                \"slug\": \"guardian\"\n            },\n            \"created_at\": \"2025-09-29T17:05:05.000000Z\",\n            \"updated_at\": \"2025-09-29T17:05:05.000000Z\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 157,\n            \"title\": \"Harris calls Trump ‘incompetent and unhinged’ and makes call to ‘fight fire with fire’\",\n            \"content\": \"<p><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\\\">Donald Trump</a> has proven himself to be an “unchecked, incompetent, unhinged president,” and his opposition must follow leaders who are ready to “fight fire with fire,” his 2024 election rival <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\\\">Kamala Harris</a> has said.</p> <p>The former Democratic US vice-president delivered those fiery remarks on Saturday evening while accepting an award from the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation in Washington DC – and after Trump’s fellow Republican allies have demanded that his liberal opponents tone down their rhetoric in the wake of the 10 September shooting <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting\\\">death of rightwing political activist Charlie Kirk</a>.</p> <p>During a nearly eight-minute speech recorded by <a href=\\\"https://www.c-span.org/clip/public-affairs-event/kamala-harris-calls-president-trump-incompetent-and-unhinged/5173595\\\">C-SPAN</a>, Harris alluded to how the second Trump administration has cut healthcare protections as well as nutrition assistance benefiting the poor. She pointed to the administration’s implementation of tariffs that preceded a reported rise in consumer prices in August. She also mentioned the administration’s axing of $500m in funding for vaccines like the ones that helped end the Covid-19 pandemic, its deploying US military troops into the streets of multiple cities and other controversial actions as Trump’s approval rating has plummeted on average <a href=\\\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/trump-approval-ratings-nate-silver-bulletin\\\">to -9.4%</a> as of Saturday.</p> <aside class=\\\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\\\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/27/amala-harris-107-days-analysis-biden-walz\\\">Kamala Harris’s new book details her steep challenges without acknowledging her failures </a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Let us be clear – we predicted all that,” Harris said, echoing her 2024 campaign <a href=\\\"https://www.c-span.org/clip/campaign-2024/harris-warns-second-trump-term-would-be-dangerous-for-america/5136694\\\">predictions</a> that a second Trump presidency would be “a huge risk for America” and “dangerous”.</p> <p>But Harris said what she never foresaw “was the capitulation” to him from once proud institutions. Top universities have <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/07/universities-settle-trump\\\">agreed to pay</a> hundreds of millions of dollars to settle antisemitism claims. Law firms have <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/trump-law-firm-executive-order\\\">acquiesced</a> to performing pro bono work for causes that are dear to Trump – and to not engage in race-conscious hiring – to avoid executive orders from the president that could substantially slow their business down. And major US media platforms such as <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/14/abc-george-stephanopoulos-trump-15-million\\\">ABC</a> and <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/22/trump-cbs-settlement-stephen-colbert\\\">CBS</a> have settled lawsuits, at multi-million dollar costs, brought against them by Trump rather than contest what pundits widely perceived to be winnable cases.</p> <p>“Universities, law firms, media corporations, the titans of industry … have been so quick to kneel before a tyrant,” Harris said.</p> <p>Harris held up what she considered to be a meaningful act of resistance: one centering on <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/23/jimmy-kimmel-return-reaction\\\">Jimmy Kimmel’s return to air</a> after ABC temporarily suspended the late-night host’s show over comments criticizing the Trump administration’s response to Kirk’s killing.</p> <p>Kimmel’s suspension was announced on 17 September after a regulator loyal to Trump threatened to revoke the broadcast licenses of ABC affiliates unless the network took action against him. The move sparked protests, free-speech concerns and a drive to cancel subscriptions to products of ABC’s owner, Disney. ABC reinstated Kimmel six days later, with his industry peers crediting that development to those who had boycotted Disney.</p> <p>And by Friday, two companies that own a combined 70 ABC affiliates and had continued boycotting Jimmy Kimmel Live! despite the host’s reinstatement agreed to broadcast it again, effectively punctuating the show’s full on-air comeback.</p> <p>“When a president with a fragile ego couldn’t take a joke and brought down the weight of the federal government to silence the voice of a citizen, folks spoke with their pocketbook, and Jimmy Kimmel is now back on the air,” Harris said.</p> <p>Harris argued too many members of Congress were content to “bend the knee and fail to uphold their constitutional duty” to serve as a check to the presidential administration. That, she said, demanded Democrats win the 2026 midterms determining which political party controls Congress for the back half of Trump’s second presidency – and then “enforce checks and balances on this unchecked, incompetent, unhinged president”.</p> <p>The ex-US senator from California subsequently called on the caucus to support leaders who know “we must fight fire with fire”.</p> <aside class=\\\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\\\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/23/kamala-harris-book-takeaways-107-days\\\">Five things we learned from 107 Days, Kamala Harris’s campaign trail memoir</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Harris was Joe Biden’s running mate when he ended Trump’s first presidency by defeating him in the 2020 election.

Here is the full text:</p> <ul> <li><p>Gaza will be a de-radicalized terror-free zone that does not pose a threat to its neighbors.</p></li> <li><p>Gaza will be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who have suffered more than enough.</p></li> <li><p>If both sides agree to this proposal, the war will immediately end. Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed upon line to prepare for a hostage release. During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal.</p></li> <li><p>Within 72 hours of Israel publicly accepting this agreement, all hostages, alive and deceased, will be returned.</p></li> <li><p>Once all hostages are released, Israel will release 250 life sentence prisoners plus 1700 Gazans who were detained after Oct. 7, 2023, including all women and children detained in that context. For every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 deceased Gazans.</p></li> <li><p>Once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful coexistence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries.</p></li> <li><p>Upon acceptance of this agreement, full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip. At a minimum, aid quantities will be consistent with what was included in the Jan. 19, 2025, agreement regarding humanitarian aid, including rehabilitation of infrastructure (water, electricity, sewage), rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries, and entry of necessary equipment to remove rubble and open roads.</p></li> <li><p>Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner with either party. Opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under the Jan. 19, 2025 agreement.</p></li> <li><p>Gaza will be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza.</p></li> <li><p>This committee will be made up of qualified Palestinians and international experts, with oversight and supervision by a new international transitional body, the “Board of Peace,” which will be headed and chaired by President Donald J. Trump, with other members and heads of State to be announced, including Former Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p></li> <li><p>This body will set the framework and handle the funding for the redevelopment of Gaza until such time as the Palestinian Authority has completed its reform program, as outlined in various proposals, including President Trump’s peace plan in 2020 and the Saudi-French proposal, and can securely and effectively take back control of Gaza. This body will call on best international standards to create modern and efficient governance that serves the people of Gaza and is conducive to attracting investment.</p></li> <li><p>A Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energize Gaza will be created by convening a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East. Many thoughtful investment proposals and exciting development ideas have been crafted by well-meaning international groups, and will be considered to synthesize the security and governance frameworks to attract and facilitate these investments that will create jobs, opportunity, and hope for future Gaza.</p></li> <li><p>A special economic zone will be established with preferred tariff and access rates to be negotiated with participating countries.</p></li> <li><p>No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return. We will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza.</p></li> <li><p>Hamas and other factions agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form. All military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt. There will be a process of demilitarization of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning, and supported by an internationally funded buy back and reintegration program all verified by the independent monitors. New Gaza will be fully committed to building a prosperous economy and to peaceful coexistence with their neighbors.</p></li> <li><p>A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people.</p></li> <li><p>The United States will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza. The ISF will train and provide support to vetted Palestinian police forces in Gaza, and will consult with Jordan and Egypt who have extensive experience in this field. This force will be the long-term internal security solution. The ISF will work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with newly trained Palestinian police forces. It is critical to prevent munitions from entering Gaza and to facilitate the rapid and secure flow of goods to rebuild and revitalize Gaza. A de-confliction mechanism will be agreed upon by the parties.</p></li> <li><p>Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. As the ISF establishes control and stability, the Israel Defense Forces (I.D.F.) will withdraw based on standards, milestones, and time frames linked to demilitarization that will be agreed upon between the IDF, ISF, the guarantors, and the United States, with the objective of a secure Gaza that no longer poses a threat to Israel, Egypt, or its citizens. Practically, the IDF will progressively hand over the Gaza territory it occupies to the ISF according to an agreement they will make with the transitional authority until they are withdrawn completely from Gaza, save for a security perimeter presence that will remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat.</p></li> <li><p>In the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operation, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF to the ISF.</p></li> <li><p>An interfaith dialogue process will be established based on the values of tolerance and peaceful coexistence to try and change mind-sets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis by emphasizing the benefits that can be derived from peace.</p></li> <li><p>While Gaza redevelopment advances and when the PA reform program is faithfully carried out, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.</p></li> <li><p>The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\\\"block-time updated-time\\\">Updated <time datetime=\\\"2025-09-29T18:51:48.915Z\\\">at 7.51pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\\\"block-68dac8e08f080edbe2663c9e\\\" class=\\\"block is-key-event\\\" data-block-contributor=\\\"\\\"> <p class=\\\"block-time published-time\\\"> <time datetime=\\\"2025-09-29T18:02:02.069Z\\\">7.02pm <span class=\\\"timezone\\\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\\\"block-title\\\">Netanyahu 'expressed deep regret' that Israeli strike on Doha killed Qatari serviceman, says White House</h2>  <div class=\\\"block-elements\\\">  <p>Here is the White House’s readout confirming the trilateral call reported earlier during which Benjamin Netanyahu <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/sep/29/donald-trump-benjamin-netanyahu-gaza-white-house-us-politics-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68dabc688f08206a90f0905c#block-68dabc688f08206a90f0905c\\\">apologized to Qatari PM</a> Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani over Israel’s strikes on Doha earlier this month.</p> <blockquote class=\\\"quoted\\\"> <p>Today, President Donald J.

But it’s peace in the Middle East,” he said.</p> <p>In other developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>More than 100,000 federal workers are to formally resign on Tuesday, the largest such mass event in US history, as part of a <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\\\">Trump administration</a> program designed to make sweeping cuts to the federal workforce.</strong> With Congress facing a deadline of Tuesday to authorize more funding or spark a <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/27/government-shutdown-explainer\\\">government shutdown</a>, the White House has also ordered federal agencies to draw up plans for large-scale firings of workers if the partisan fight fails to yield a deal.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Donald Trump has reversed course and is purportedly planning to host a bipartisan gathering of the top four US congressional leaders at the White House on Monday afternoon in a last-ditch effort to avoid a looming government shutdown</strong>, the House speaker and the US president’s fellow Republican, Mike Johnson, said on Sunday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/25/james-comey-fbi-director-indictment\\\">indictment</a> of former FBI director <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/james-comey\\\">James Comey</a> is part of a concerted effort by <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\\\">Donald Trump</a> to “rewrite history” in his favor</strong>, a former senior White House lawyer claimed on Sunday as he warned of more retribution to come for the president’s political opponents.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The mayor of <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\\\">New York City</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-adams\\\">Eric Adams</a>, announced on Sunday that he was abandoning his faltering bid to win re-election, just over a month before election day.</strong> Adams, who was trailing in the polls, was elected as a <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\\\">Democrat</a> but ran for re-election as an independent after he was indicted on federal corruption charges, which were <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/eric-adams-corruption-case-dismissed\\\">then dropped</a> by the <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\\\">Trump administration</a> in exchange for his cooperation on immigration raids.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Children, including the very young, have been spending weeks or months in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention facility in a remote part of Texas where outside monitors have heard accounts of shortages of clean drinking water, chronic sleep deprivation and kids struggling for hygiene supplies and prompt medical attention</strong>, as revealed in a stark new court filing.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\\\"block-time updated-time\\\">Updated <time datetime=\\\"2025-09-29T10:58:06.490Z\\\">at 11.58am BST</time></p>  </div>\",\n            \"excerpt\": \"Netanyahu says he supports Trump’s Gaza peace plan but Hamas still must agree to proposal\",\n            \"author\": \"Lois Beckett (now); Lucy Campbell, Rachel Leingang and Tom Ambrose (earlier)\",\n            \"category\": \"US news\",\n            \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/sep/29/donald-trump-benjamin-netanyahu-gaza-white-house-us-politics-live\",\n            \"image_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6855d1ff0f1594a3d9aba5cbb5ee09ac76df1ca/473_0_3985_3188/500.jpg\",\n            \"published_at\": \"2025-09-29T21:00:03.000000Z\",\n            \"source\": {\n                \"id\": 2,\n                \"name\": \"The Guardian\",\n                \"slug\": \"guardian\"\n            },\n            \"created_at\": \"2025-09-29T16:47:21.000000Z\",\n            \"updated_at\": \"2025-09-29T21:10:07.000000Z\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 214,\n            \"title\": \"US whistleblowers say they were fired for raising fair housing concerns\",\n            \"content\": \"<p>Two attorneys in the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) anti-discrimination division said they were fired on Monday, a week after <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/24/trump-housing-urban-development-segregation-whistleblowers\\\">going public</a> with a whistleblower report alleging that the Trump administration had dismantled efforts to combat residential segregation.</p> <p>Paul Osadebe and Palmer Heenan worked in Hud’s Office of Fair Housing (OFH), which is tasked with bringing cases against parties accused of discriminating against tenants and homebuyers under a landmark civil rights law. In a report sent last month to Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren, Heenan, Osadebe and two anonymous colleagues wrote that fighting discrimination under the Fair Housing Act of 1968 was “not a priority” for the administration, and that their office had been targeted for downsizing because it presented an “optics problem”.</p> <p>On Monday, Osadebe was called into a meeting with HUD managers, who informed him he was being placed on leave in anticipation of firing. A document he was given cited interviews he had given to <a href=\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/22/realestate/trump-fair-housing-laws.html\\\">the New York Times</a> and <a href=\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/09/04/federal-government-job-changes/\\\">Washington Post</a> as violating department policy.</p> <p>“This was purely for whistleblowing activity. There was nothing about conduct, performance, any of that,” Osadebe said in an interview. “They said, this is why we’re firing you, because you spoke out. They are as blatant as can be about it.”</p> <p>Heenan, who was in the probationary phase of his employment, was fired in a similar meeting for “the disclosure of non-public information”, according to a letter he was given by HUD.</p> <p>The department’s press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs, said in a statement following the firings: “Donald Trump doesn’t want Americans to know that his administration is engaged in a systemic attack on their rights.</p> <p>“So the Trump administration is silencing those who are speaking out about how Donald Trump and Scott Turner [the HUD secretary] are turning their backs on the American people, including women experiencing domestic violence, families being denied mortgages because of the color of their skin, and older folks who need extra help getting down the stairs.”</p> <p>Heenan and Osadebe were recently told they would be moved out of the OFH, which had already lost several staff members and was poised to shrink further through a series of reassignments. Last week, they and three other colleagues sued Turner to prevent the transfers, arguing they were part of the effort to undermine enforcement of the law.</p> <p>“Although we knew we were taking a risk, I am still surprised that this administration would violate the whistleblower statute so blatantly,” Heenan said, referring to federal law intended to protect employees who make reports like theirs.</p> <p>“I’m not going to stop speaking out.

The concentrated bloodletting, spread out across four states, took the lives of nine people, including the suspect in Sunday’s shooting at Grand Blanc’s Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints church, as well as injuring at least 33.</p> <p>The weekend’s spate brings the archive’s <a href=\\\"https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/\\\">tally</a> of mass shootings – defined as events with at least four victims injured or killed, not counting the shooter – to 324 this year alone, as of Monday morning. That is a rate of more than one a day.</p> <p>The weekend’s carnage began in the early hours of Saturday morning when multiple shots were fired in separate incidents in Alexandria, Louisiana, and in Raleigh, North Carolina. At least four people were injured on <a href=\\\"https://www.kalb.com/2025/09/27/rpso-multiple-people-shot-hwy-71-saturday-morning/\\\">Highway 71 South</a> in Alexandria.</p> <p>At about the same time, 4am local time, four people were shot and injured on <a href=\\\"https://www.wral.com/news/local/hookah-millbrook-shooting-sept-2025/\\\">Millbrook Road in Raleigh</a>. Three of the hurt individuals were found at the scene of the gunfire, and a fourth presented later at hospital.</p> <p>Saturday’s third mass shooting broke out at about 9.30pm when a gunman armed with a semi-automatic, short-barreled rifle opened fire from a boat on a waterfront bar in <a href=\\\"https://www.wyff4.com/article/north-carolina-restaurant-shooting-gunman-boat/68097548\\\">Southport, North Carolina</a>. The shooting left three people dead and eight injured.</p>    <p>Local news reporters said the target had been the American Fish Company. The suspect fled by boat but was arrested by the US Coast Guard and has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder and other felonies.</p> <p>Then, just before midnight on Saturday, a 34-year-old gunman opened fire at <a href=\\\"https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2025/09/28/2-killed-several-injured-in-shooting-at-kickapoo-lucky-eagle-casino-maverick-county-judge-says/\\\">Kickapoo Lucky Eagle Casino</a> along the border with Mexico in Texas. The gambling spot was packed at the time with customers at a raffle event.</p> <p>One person was pronounced dead at the casino and a second died on the way to hospital. One of those killed was a retired US Customs and Border Protection officer, the mayor of Eagle Pass said on social media.</p> <p>The suspected shooter has been charged with two counts of murder carrying the possibility of the death penalty.</p> <p>The intense burst of mass shootings underlines America’s crisis of gun violence fueled by the country’s unique relationship with firearms. There are almost <a href=\\\"https://www.thetrace.org/2023/03/guns-america-data-atf-total/\\\">400m guns</a> in circulation in the US – far more than in any other wealthy country.</p> <p>Mass shootings are just the thin end of a very thick wedge. Though they are among the most heavily reported and terror-inducing cases, the scourge of gun deaths extends far wider than that.</p> <p>In 2023, the last year for which official figures are given, nearly 47,000 people died by the gun in the US, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It was the third-highest year on record, after a Covid pandemic-induced spike through the previous two years.</p> <p>The weekend’s devastating run of mass shootings carried into Sunday. At about 2.22am, shots rang out when a fight appeared to break out on <a href=\\\"https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/crime/1-killed-3-injured-in-bourbon-street-shooting-nopd-says-crime-new-orleans-police-investigation-shooting-gun-violence/289-f8160f83-4b28-497b-a714-8a30e6be45e0\\\">Bourbon Street</a>, the famous tourist destination in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana. Four people were struck, including a woman who died at the scene, police said.</p> <p>New Orleans police superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said the woman who died was a 33-year-old bystander celebrating her birthday from Chicago.

Lor spent three years behind bars after being convicted of property, drug and weapons crimes when he was 21. The operation was the latest in a wave of deportation flights that have roiled south-east Asian enclaves in the midwest and across the country.</p> <p>Since Donald Trump took office for a second time, forced removals of south-east Asians with criminal records have soared. In a single flight over Memorial Day weekend, Ice deported 93 Vietnamese and 65 Laotian nationals, according to Vo Danh, a collective of organizers advocating for the abolition of Ice. The Lao Embassy said that it has issued <a href=\\\"https://www.startribune.com/hmong-minnesotans-face-deportation-laos-ice-arrests/601385285\\\">145 people travel papers</a> for deportation since January – a more than tenfold increase from previous years.</p> <p>In the Twin Cities, home to the largest Hmong population outside of the US, immigrant advocates have been protesting and pushing hard for immigration reform, as more than 150 south-east Asians in Minnesota have been deported since May.</p> <p>Kaohly Vang Her, a state representative, said she’s been discussing with Tim Walz, the governor, and Keith Ellison, the attorney general, about expediting the state pardon process, which can shield people from deportation by vacating their convictions.</p> <p>The approach yielded some success in New York, as the governor Kathy Hochul pardoned a Lao refugee in early July to spare him from deportation, following a yearslong campaign from grassroots organizers.</p> <p>Besides expediting the pardon process, Her said there are unfortunately few other levers that state legislators can pull. She’s instead focusing on informing her constituents about relevant immigration news, such as which Minnesota counties have agreements with Ice.</p>    <p>Many formerly incarcerated south-east Asians who are facing deportation, Her said, have long reformed and raised families. They work and pay taxes.</p> <p>Ripping away breadwinners from families, Her said, creates “a ripple effect that will be really challenging to overcome”. Mothers and grandparents might have to apply for public assistance, she said, and a new generation of children could grow up with trauma.</p> <p>South-east Asians are <a href=\\\"https://searac.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SEAA-School-to-Deportation-Pipeline_0.pdfhttps://searac.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SEAA-School-to-Deportation-Pipeline_0.pdf\\\">three to five times more likely</a> to be deported than other immigrant groups due to a prior conviction, which can strip someone’s legal permanent resident status. The administration’s targeting of south-east Asians with old convictions, community advocates say, is creating yet another cycle of trauma and displacement for a group that’s suffered under generations of US foreign policy.</p> <p>“We see these deportations as a betrayal of US duty to refugees,” said Quyen Dinh, executive director of the Southeast Asian Resource Center. “When you accept a refugee, you don’t accept them for just three to five years, you accept them for their entire lifetime.”</p> <p>Since the fall of Saigon in 1975, more than 1.2 million refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos have settled in the US, forming the country’s largest refugee diaspora. Thousands of Hmong, fearing retaliation for their alliance with the US in the secret war, fled to refugee camps in Thailand before also making their way to America.</p> <p>Many south-east Asians settled in low-income communities – including Long Beach and Stockton, California, and St Paul, Minnesota – with substandard housing and low-paying jobs, and few resources to treat lingering war trauma. Due to a lack of effective refugee resettlement programs in the 1980s and 1990s, Dihn said, many young people ended up joining gangs and committing crimes of poverty. Xiao said Lor was one example of this – that he had fallen in with a tough crowd after resettling in the US as a teenager who barely understood English.</p> <p>More than 3 million people of south-east Asian descent reside in the US today, <a href=\\\"https://searac.org/news/capac-discusses-alarming-rise-of-southeast-asian-deportations-under-trump/\\\">17,000 of whom have removal orders</a> largely tied to past convictions. More than 2,000 have been deported.</p> <p>What helped paved the way for this, Dinh said, was the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which expanded the crimes that made immigrants eligible for deportation. It also made it harder for undocumented immigrants to gain legal status. Before the law was enacted, Dinh said, permanent residents and refugees who committed a crime would not be automatically deported, and would be given the right to plead their cases of transformation.</p> <p>This year, deportations have accelerated as the Trump administration threatened sanctions to pressure Laos, which doesn’t have a formal repatriation agreement with the US, to take back deportees. Many immigration advocates are expecting the raids to ramp up after the supreme court lifted an order on 8 September that barred the administration from stopping people solely based on their race, language or job.</p> <p>Tin Thanh Nguyen, a North Carolina-based immigration attorney, is representing <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/02/lawyers-say-men-deported-by-us-to-eswatini-are-being-imprisoned-illegally\\\">two refugees from Vietnam and Laos</a> who were flown in July to a maximum security prison in southern Africa. The men, aged 34 and 45, arrived in the US when they were children, Nguyen said. Both had served time for criminal offenses they committed as teenagers.</p> <p>Nguyen said formerly incarcerated south-east Asians are easy targets for mass deportation because their information is already in the system as they attend annual Ice check-ins.</p> <p>“They’re low-lying fruit,” Nguyen said. “They have final orders of removal and they’ve been checking in with Ice for years.”</p> <p>In previous years, Nguyen said he was helping people fight those removal orders. The Trump administration is removing so many people so quickly that the strategy is no longer viable, he said. His focus now is helping detainees obtain travel documents so they can be sent to their homeland and not a third country.</p> <p>Thao Ha, the executive director of the non-profit Collective Freedom, said new deportees to Laos need help securing safe housing, employment and citizenship. Loved ones in the US have turned to GoFundMe to raise money for food, clothing and basic necessities.</p> <p>For those with final removal orders, Ha said, the cruelty of the process itself is often more frightening than the prospect of restarting their lives in another country.</p> <p>“They’ve accepted that deportation is their fate,” she said. “But why does it have to be this way, the sudden detention, sudden snatching away without warning?”</p> <p>Kua Yang had been a free man for only a year and a half when he was deported to Laos, a country he had never been to.</p> <p>Yang, 47, was born in a refugee camp in Thailand and resettled with his family in Stockton, California. At 16, he received a life sentence for gang-related armed robbery. In 2023, after serving 28 years in prison, he was released on parole and reconnected with his mother and two sisters, who he hadn’t seen since they were infants. He taught their daughters how to read and write.</p> <p>Then, in March, the crime for which Yang spent half a lifetime repenting sent him to a foreign homeland. In Vientiane, the sweltering Laotian capital, he saw widespread despair.</p> <p>“Some people miss their kids so much,” he said. “They just stay in their rooms and drink.”</p> <p>So Yang and two other deportees partnered with Collective Freedom to help new deportees readjust and find housing. They deliver care packages, hygiene items, food and cash to anyone who needs it. He’s working on establishing a transitional home with job training workshops. During the week, he teaches English to Lao citizens.</p> <p>“Helping others gave me a purpose,” he said. “When I first came here I thought, ‘What am I going to do in this land?’ Now, I’d say I believe in a life here.”</p>\",\n            \"excerpt\": \"Administration’s targeting of group settled in the US after fleeing war in Vietnam creating further displacement\",\n            \"author\": \"Claire Wang\",\n            \"category\": \"US news\",\n            \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/29/ice-deportation-south-east-asians-vietnam-war\",\n            \"image_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/50b85c3da0b9aab2052e876ded97895d421b0498/690_0_6869_5499/500.jpg\",\n            \"published_at\": \"2025-09-29T15:00:32.000000Z\",\n            \"source\": {\n                \"id\": 2,\n                \"name\": \"The Guardian\",\n                \"slug\": \"guardian\"\n            },\n            \"created_at\": \"2025-09-29T16:47:21.000000Z\",\n            \"updated_at\": \"2025-09-29T16:47:21.000000Z\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 99,\n            \"title\": \"Michigan car crash kills three family members from TLC’s Meet the Putmans\",\n            \"content\": \"<p>Three members of the <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michigan\\\">Michigan</a>-based family featured on TLC’s reality show Meet the Putmans were recently killed in a car crash, and five other members were injured.</p> <p>In a <a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DPG5kTDDqxx/\\\">statement</a> shared on Saturday, the family said its patriarch Bill “Papa” Putman, his wife, Barb – who goes by Neenee – and their daughter-in-law Megan were killed in a “tragic car accident” that was evidently reported the previous night.</p> <p>“They have gone home to be with the Lord,” the statement added.</p> <p>The family added that members identified&nbsp;as Uncle Blake, Lulu, Alena, Noah and Gia were also injured in the crash and remained hospitalized.</p> <p>“We are asking for complete healing and strength for each of them,” they said.

The Pew Research Center’s most recent <a href=\\\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/\\\">religious landscape study</a> estimates that about 1% of the US population, or about 2.6 million people identify with the Synod, putting the denomination at approximately half the size of the ELCA.</p> <p>The revelations about Eidsmoe, whose links to neo-Confederate organizations have previously ignited scandal for high profile Republican politicians, are just the most recent in a series of connections between LCMS and far-right and white supremacist individuals which have roiled the congregation since 2023.</p> <p>In a telephone call, Eidsmoe confirmed that he was an ordained Lutheran minister currently serving a Presbyterian congregation in Alabama. Asked if he was a neo-Confederate, Eidsmoe said “no, I would not,” however: “I believe that there are some good values in southern culture, and I believe that the South had a constitutional right to secede.”</p> <p>Eidsmoe also denied any direct links to LCMS, saying: “I wouldn’t say there’s really any relationship with the Missouri Synod. I did speak once for Lutheran Classical College but only as a guest speaker and I’m on the board of Lutherans for Life, which is not a Missouri Synod organization it’s pan-Lutheran.”</p> <p>When the Guardian pointed out that Lutherans for Life is a Registered Service Organization of LCMS, he said: “Well yes, but I mean a lot of organizations that are not Missouri Synod are nevertheless licensed in that way.”</p> <p>In response to an email requesting comment, the Rev Roy S Askins, LCMS managing director of editorial and theological content, wrote: “Col. John Eidsmoe is not an LCMS pastor nor a member of any LCMS congregation.”</p> <p>He did not respond to a further request to clarify Eidsmoe’s involvement in LCMS-aligned organizations.</p> <p>Hours after the request was sent, LCMS president Matthew Harrison posted a long message to Facebook which in part read: “A few on our far edges say untoward things about race, failing to take into account the beautiful message of the N.T. that “God is no respecter of persons.” (Acts 10) And that repeatedly in the N.T. we see lists of early Christians which include multiple ethnicities from around the Mediterranean world.”</p> <p>Joshua Salzberg is a member of an LCMS church, and co-founder of Lutherans for Racial Justice, which has been critical of the congregation’s approach to racial issues, and the presence of far-right figures connected to LCMS.</p> <p>Salzburg said: “When neo-Confederate figures go unchecked in LCMS spaces, it opens the door for more far right voices to gain influence.</p> <p>Salzberg added: “My hope is that there would be at least as much energy for reckoning with Neo-confederate views that contradict the teachings of The LCMS as there is for other views that brush up against the Synod’s doctrine.”.</p> <p>Jeff Tischauser, a senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), said of the CCC: “While the group’s influence is waning, and while its influence even within the white power movement is minimal, the CCC can still attract violent racists who the group further radicalizes, as shown with Dylann Roof. So just because it’s fractured and the influence isn’t there doesn’t mean that it’s not dangerous because of the content that it produces.”</p> <h2>Eidsmoe’s LCMS connections</h2> <p>Eidsmoe, a retired colonel of both the USAF and the Mississippi state guard according to his online biographies, is an ordained pastor who <a href=\\\"https://woodlandpca.org/our-pastor/\\\">currently serves a Presbyterian church</a> in Notasulga, Alabama.</p> <p>But Eidsmoe is or has been affiliated with several organizations which are directly affiliated with the LCMS, or who have sought affiliation from the organization.</p> <p>According to the website of anti-abortion group <a href=\\\"https://lutheransforlife.org/bod/col-john-eidsmoe-pike-road-alabama/\\\">Lutherans for Life</a>, which is a Recognized Service Organization (RSO) of LCMS, Eidsmoe is a board member. The <a href=\\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201021194626/https://lutheransforlife.org/bod/col-john-eidsmoe-pike-road-alabama/\\\">earliest Internet Archive snapshot</a> of his biography page is from 2020, indicating that he has been on the board for at least five years.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\\\"https://www.lcms.org/how-we-serve/mercy/recognized-service-organizations\\\">LCMS website</a>, RSOs are “not-for-profit organizations that are independent” of LCMS, but “operate ministry programs that foster the mission and ministry of the church”. RSO affiliation is subject to LCMS approval.</p> <p>Just weeks ago, Eidsmoe <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgANBsm3rE0\\\">spoke at Luther Classical College’s Christian Culture Conference</a> at the college’s campus in Casper, Wyoming. That college was founded by LCMS clergy and laity.

CAW is not directly affiliated with LCMS but with the Evangelical Lutheran Synod, a separate, much smaller Lutheran denomination that shares similar conservative commitments to LCMS.</p> <h2>Neo-Confederate connections</h2> <p>Along with LCMS links, Eidsmoe also has long-standing links to the neo-Confederate movement, which describes a variety of organizations and activists who at best offer revisionist accounts of the south’s efforts to preserve slavery by seceding from the US, and at worst argue for the restoration or secession of a segregated, white supremacist Confederacy.</p> <p>These connections have drawn national coverage in the past due to Eidsmoe’s connections to high-profile Republican politicians including Roy Moore and Michele Bachmann.</p> <p>According to the organization’s website, Eidsmoe still serves as <a href=\\\"https://www.morallaw.org/our-staff\\\">senior counsel at the Foundation for Moral Law</a>, founded by failed senate candidate Roy Moore.</p> <p>Moore’s chaotic bid to become senator for Alabama after previous incumbent Jeff Sessions entered the first Trump administration failed <a href=\\\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42054780\\\">amid accusations that he had sexually abused a 14 year-old girl</a> when he was a 32 year-old prosecutor in the late 1970s. Moore denied those allegations, but lost the special election.</p> <p>But his association with Eidsmoe also drew critical reporting at that time.</p> <p>During his run, CNN <a href=\\\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/27/politics/kfile-roy-moore-secession-day-events\\\">reported on a “Secession Day” event</a> held at the premises of the Moore’s Moral Law Foundation in which Eidsmoe was a prominent participant.</p> <p>According to CNN, video of the event showed “Alabama’s 1861 secession flag and a banner ‘in memory of the men in gray’ who fought to maintain ‘the principles of the Constitution’ in the Civil War.”</p> <p>The report continued: “Among those in the video was John Eidsmoe, who was hired to join the foundation’s legal team in 2008 and is still listed on its website as the senior counsel and resident scholar.”</p> <p>Earlier, during the rise of the Tea Party movement, associations with Eidsmoe troubled both Moore, who made a run as a Tea Party candidate for Alabama governor in 2010, and Michele Bachmann, who was the most visible Tea Party affiliate in Congress where she served between 2007 and 2015.</p> <p>In 2010, Eidsmoe pulled out from speaking at a Tea Party event in Wausau, Wisconsin, after reporters unearthed his record of his <a href=\\\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/hatewatch/anti-lgbt-rally-montgomery-draws-strong-rhetoric-and-league-south-0/\\\">previous speeches</a> hosted by the neo-Confederate organizations the League of the South and the Council of Concerned Citizens.</p> <p><a href=\\\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/league-south/\\\">The League of the South</a>, founded in 1994, advocates for a return to white supremacist rule in a secessionist south. The CCC is a white nationalist group formed in 1985, which according to the Southern Poverty Law Center is a descendant of the white citizens councils that were formed to resist school desegregation in the 1950s and 1960s.</p> <p>The two organizations have made common cause in protests against the <a href=\\\"https://www.adl.org/resources/news/council-conservative-citizens-declining-bastion-hate\\\">removal of Confederate monuments</a>. For the League of the South this culminated in their participation in 2017’s deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p> <p>The CCC’s propaganda about race and crime <a href=\\\"https://www.learningforjustice.org/magazine/fall-2017/the-miseducation-of-dylann-roof\\\">informed Dylann Roof’s radicalization</a>. In 2011, Eidsmoe was cited in media reports as a formative influence on Republican politician Michele Bachmann, for whom she worked as a research assistant while she was a student and he a professor at the fundamentalist Oral Roberts University. He was described as Bachmann’s “<a href=\\\"https://newrepublic.com/article/93333/michelle-bachmanns-intellectual-worldview\\\">law school mentor</a>”. <a href=\\\"https://www.npr.org/2011/08/09/139084313/the-books-and-beliefs-shaping-michele-bachmann\\\">Reportedly</a>, Eidsmoe influenced Bachmann’s belief that “American law should be based on the Bible.”</p> <p>These national scandals did not dissuade Eidsmoe of his radical rightwing beliefs.</p> <p>In 2019, he penned a <a href=\\\"https://www.abbevilleinstitute.org/a-copperhead-loves-the-south/\\\">lengthy essay</a> for the neo-Confederate Abbeville Institute, in which he ran through a number of familiar revisionist talking points on the US civil war, claiming that slavery was not the main or only reason for secession, praised confederate president Jefferson Davis and pro-slavery politician and writer John C Calhoun.</p> <p>He wrote: “We object to judging the South on slavery alone, when there was so much good about the South as well. And those good things are what soldiers fought and died for.”</p> <p>The central argument of the essay was against the removal of Confederate statues from public places, writing at one point: “Behind the drive to remove flags and monuments is a drive to re-write history itself, as a prerequisite to fashioning a new America that bears no resemblance to the constitutional republic our Founding Fathers designed.”</p> <h2>LCMS controversies</h2> <p>The Eidsmoe connection is just the most recent intrusion of far-right politics into a denomination that has historically held politics at arms length.</p> <p>Just last week, the <a href=\\\"https://www.alreporter.com/2025/09/04/lutheran-church-in-ozark-hosts-neo-confederate-group/\\\">Alabama Political Reporter revealed</a> that an LCMS church, the Prince of Peace Lutheran Church in Ozark Alabama, has allowed the neo-Confederate group the Southern Cultural Center (SCC) to hold monthly meetings at their facilities for members in that region.</p> <p>In August, the SCC Ozark meeting hosted Eric Orwoll as a guest speaker. Orwoll is the driving force behind the effort to establish Return to the Land, a <a href=\\\"https://www.wired.com/story/whites-only-community-arkansas/\\\">whites-only housing development</a> in Arkansas.</p> <p>Previously, SCC guest speakers have reportedly included <a href=\\\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/john-weaver/\\\">neo-Confederate pastor John Weaver</a> and the <a href=\\\"https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/jared-taylor/\\\">white nationalist founder of American Renaissance,</a> Jared Taylor.</p> <p>Historically, the LCMS has maintained a doctrinally and scripturally more conservative position than the mainline ELCA, but in contrast to some other evangelical groups they have largely steered clear of involvement in partisan politics or religiously-inflected culture wars.</p> <p>In recent years, however, LCMS has been repeatedly roiled by controversies driven by members of the denomination with connections to far-right groups.</p> <p>In 2023, the denomination drew national attention after it became a focus of far-right organizing.</p> <p>First, white nationalist Corey Mahler targeted the LCMS in his <a href=\\\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/lutheran-church-white-nationalism-rejection-1234690317/\\\">attempts to lead an “influx of hardline young men”</a> into LCMS churches, reportedly promising: “The Millennials who will replace the feckless, spineless, degenerate boomers will be sure to settle accounts and amend the errors of the past century” and that “very soon, we will expel the liberals”.</p> <p>Mahler had been <a href=\\\"https://archive.ph/e01XU\\\">identified by antifascist researchers Machaira Action</a> as a leading light in what they called a “Lutefash” tendency in the Lutheran Church.</p> <p>Mahler was excommunicated from his Lutheran church in Knoxville, Tennessee, that year.</p> <p>Ryan Turnipseed, was also identified by Machaira Action as a member of the “Lutefash” tendency. He was excommunicated in May 2024 by First Lutheran church in his home city of Ponca City, Oklahoma, after a viral 2023 Twitter thread criticizing the LCMS’s new catechism, alleging that it incorporated too many “woke” liberal positions. The move had briefly made him a cause celebre for the online far right.</p> <p>Soon after, the president of the Lutheran church-Missouri synod <a href=\\\"https://ministrywatch.com/lutheran-church-missouri-synod-president-calls-for-excommunicating-white-nationalists/\\\">called for</a> the excommunication of those “propagating radical and unchristian ‘alt-right’ views”.</p> <p>However, weeks after Turnipseed’s excommunication, the LCMS church Immanuel Lutheran of Wichita, Kansas, <a href=\\\"https://evangelicaldarkweb.org/2024/05/28/lcms-whistleblower-excommunication-defied-by-member-church/\\\">undermined the ban</a> by accepting Turnipseed into membership.</p> <p>In July, the Guardian <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/05/far-right-mens-clubs-old-glory\\\">reported</a> that Turnipseed is a leading member of the antisemitic, Christian Nationalist, men-only Old Glory Club, whose network of nationwide lodges is designed to provide in-person meetups and conferences for far-right activists.</p> <p>Salzberger, the racial justice activist, wrote: “As a grassroots organization, Lutherans for Racial Justice hopes to help educate the church on these topics, so that we’re better prepared to recognize white supremacist ideology in all its forms.”</p>\",\n            \"excerpt\": \"John Eidsmoe, associated with Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, has history with public defenses of Confederacy\",\n            \"author\": \"Jason Wilson\",\n            \"category\": \"US news\",\n            \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/29/pastor-john-eidsmoe-lutheran-lutheran-church-missouri-synod-neo-confederate\",\n            \"image_url\": \"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b5a4e3aa78fd4dd41a011107c7d3a2b760effcf/106_2456_2964_2372/500.jpg\",\n            \"published_at\": \"2025-09-29T11:00:27.000000Z\",\n            \"source\": {\n                \"id\": 2,\n                \"name\": \"The Guardian\",\n                \"slug\": \"guardian\"\n            },\n            \"created_at\": \"2025-09-29T17:05:05.000000Z\",\n            \"updated_at\": \"2025-09-29T17:05:05.000000Z\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 157,\n            \"title\": \"Harris calls Trump ‘incompetent and unhinged’ and makes call to ‘fight fire with fire’\",\n            \"content\": \"<p><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\\\">Donald Trump</a> has proven himself to be an “unchecked, incompetent, unhinged president,” and his opposition must follow leaders who are ready to “fight fire with fire,” his 2024 election rival <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\\\">Kamala Harris</a> has said.</p> <p>The former Democratic US vice-president delivered those fiery remarks on Saturday evening while accepting an award from the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation in Washington DC – and after Trump’s fellow Republican allies have demanded that his liberal opponents tone down their rhetoric in the wake of the 10 September shooting <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting\\\">death of rightwing political activist Charlie Kirk</a>.</p> <p>During a nearly eight-minute speech recorded by <a href=\\\"https://www.c-span.org/clip/public-affairs-event/kamala-harris-calls-president-trump-incompetent-and-unhinged/5173595\\\">C-SPAN</a>, Harris alluded to how the second Trump administration has cut healthcare protections as well as nutrition assistance benefiting the poor. She pointed to the administration’s implementation of tariffs that preceded a reported rise in consumer prices in August. She also mentioned the administration’s axing of $500m in funding for vaccines like the ones that helped end the Covid-19 pandemic, its deploying US military troops into the streets of multiple cities and other controversial actions as Trump’s approval rating has plummeted on average <a href=\\\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/trump-approval-ratings-nate-silver-bulletin\\\">to -9.4%</a> as of Saturday.</p> <aside class=\\\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\\\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/27/amala-harris-107-days-analysis-biden-walz\\\">Kamala Harris’s new book details her steep challenges without acknowledging her failures </a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Let us be clear – we predicted all that,” Harris said, echoing her 2024 campaign <a href=\\\"https://www.c-span.org/clip/campaign-2024/harris-warns-second-trump-term-would-be-dangerous-for-america/5136694\\\">predictions</a> that a second Trump presidency would be “a huge risk for America” and “dangerous”.</p> <p>But Harris said what she never foresaw “was the capitulation” to him from once proud institutions. Top universities have <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/07/universities-settle-trump\\\">agreed to pay</a> hundreds of millions of dollars to settle antisemitism claims. Law firms have <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/trump-law-firm-executive-order\\\">acquiesced</a> to performing pro bono work for causes that are dear to Trump – and to not engage in race-conscious hiring – to avoid executive orders from the president that could substantially slow their business down. And major US media platforms such as <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/14/abc-george-stephanopoulos-trump-15-million\\\">ABC</a> and <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/22/trump-cbs-settlement-stephen-colbert\\\">CBS</a> have settled lawsuits, at multi-million dollar costs, brought against them by Trump rather than contest what pundits widely perceived to be winnable cases.</p> <p>“Universities, law firms, media corporations, the titans of industry … have been so quick to kneel before a tyrant,” Harris said.</p> <p>Harris held up what she considered to be a meaningful act of resistance: one centering on <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/23/jimmy-kimmel-return-reaction\\\">Jimmy Kimmel’s return to air</a> after ABC temporarily suspended the late-night host’s show over comments criticizing the Trump administration’s response to Kirk’s killing.</p> <p>Kimmel’s suspension was announced on 17 September after a regulator loyal to Trump threatened to revoke the broadcast licenses of ABC affiliates unless the network took action against him. The move sparked protests, free-speech concerns and a drive to cancel subscriptions to products of ABC’s owner, Disney. ABC reinstated Kimmel six days later, with his industry peers crediting that development to those who had boycotted Disney.</p> <p>And by Friday, two companies that own a combined 70 ABC affiliates and had continued boycotting Jimmy Kimmel Live! despite the host’s reinstatement agreed to broadcast it again, effectively punctuating the show’s full on-air comeback.</p> <p>“When a president with a fragile ego couldn’t take a joke and brought down the weight of the federal government to silence the voice of a citizen, folks spoke with their pocketbook, and Jimmy Kimmel is now back on the air,” Harris said.</p> <p>Harris argued too many members of Congress were content to “bend the knee and fail to uphold their constitutional duty” to serve as a check to the presidential administration. That, she said, demanded Democrats win the 2026 midterms determining which political party controls Congress for the back half of Trump’s second presidency – and then “enforce checks and balances on this unchecked, incompetent, unhinged president”.</p> <p>The ex-US senator from California subsequently called on the caucus to support leaders who know “we must fight fire with fire”.</p> <aside class=\\\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\\\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/23/kamala-harris-book-takeaways-107-days\\\">Five things we learned from 107 Days, Kamala Harris’s campaign trail memoir</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Harris was Joe Biden’s running mate when he ended Trump’s first presidency by defeating him in the 2020 election.

The ADL previously defended Musk against accusations of antisemitism after he gave <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/20/trump-elon-musk-salute\\\">what were widely criticized as two fascist-style salutes</a> on stage following Trump’s inauguration.</p> <aside class=\\\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\\\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/24/charlie-kirk-conspiracies-rightwing-podcasters\\\">Rightwing podcasters run rampant with Charlie Kirk conspiracies: ‘It’s craven opportunism’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Using such false and defamatory labels about people and organizations encourages murder,” Musk said in response.</p> <p>Musk’s attacks on the ADL show that his recently positive relationship to the organization, which came to his aid after the inauguration, has soured. The ADL’s defense of Musk, who has repeatedly denied being antisemitic, led to <a href=\\\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/inside-adl-anti-defamation-league-greenblatt-zionism-trump-gaza.html\\\">immense backlash </a>from longtime donors and staff.</p> <p>The Tesla CEO also responded to several other rightwing influencer accounts targeting the ADL, some of whom have been seeking punishment of groups or individuals that have been critical of Kirk after his killing. They shared screenshots on Sunday of a page from the ADL’s website that documents <a href=\\\"https://extremism.gwu.edu/christian-identity-reborn-evolution-and-revitalization-antisemitic-theology\\\">the Christian Identity movement</a>, an extremist ideology dating back to the 19th century which promotes a racial holy war against Jews and other minority groups.</p> <p>The ADL’s page on Kirk’s organization states: “TPUSA’s leadership and activists have made multiple racist or bigoted comments and have been linked to a variety of extremists”, citing <a href=\\\"https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/turning-point-usa\\\">numerous incidents</a> such as a TPUSA chapter head posting a joke about the murder of three Black students at their university; another chapter president caught on video yelling “white power”; and the organization inviting a prominent white nationalist to speak at Iowa State University.</p> <p>“The idea that @ADL is anti-Christian is offensive and wrong. Many of our staff members are Christian. Many of our supporters are Christian. We are blessed to work with many Christian brothers and sisters in the shared fight against antisemitism and all forms of hate,” Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL’s CEO, posted. The statements from the ADL and Greenblatt did not address the page on TPUSA.</p> <p>The ADL’s backing of Musk was a rare example of an anti-hate group supporting the tech mogul, who has faced years of criticism from extremism monitors over his amplification of far-right content. Earlier this year, the head of Yad Vashem, Israel’s memorial to victims of the Holocaust, <a href=\\\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/27/nx-s1-5276084/elon-musk-german-far-right-afd-holocaust\\\">denounced Musk’s endorsement</a> of Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and his statement that Germans should move “past guilt”.</p> <p>The organization’s relationship with Musk has been a <a href=\\\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/adl-elon-musk-controversy/\\\">continual source of contention</a> for the organization, which has faced backlash in recent years over its narrowing mission and Greenblatt’s leadership.</p> <p>ADL <a href=\\\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/adl-elon-musk-controversy/\\\">staffers have previously alleged</a> that Greenblatt has pursued pro-Israel policies and cozied up to powerful actors such as Musk in a way that has undermined the ADL’s broader goal of combating extremism.</p> <p>The ADL faced <a href=\\\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/inside-adl-anti-defamation-league-greenblatt-zionism-trump-gaza.html\\\">more internal turmoil</a> earlier this year after it called Musk’s on-stage salute “an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute” and asked that “all sides should give one another a bit of grace, perhaps even the benefit of the doubt”. Since defending his gestures, the organization has criticized Musk for incidents that have included <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/09/grok-ai-praised-hitler-antisemitism-x-ntwnfb\\\">his Grok AI chatbot praising nazism</a> and calling itself “MechaHitler”.</p> <p>In another incident from 2023, Musk faced widespread criticism after he endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory on X that Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites”. Greenblatt <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2024/jan/05/adl-pro-israel-advocacy-zionism-antisemitism\\\">praised Musk days later,</a> however, after the billionaire posted that the pro-Palestinian slogan “From the river to the sea” would violate X’s content moderation policies.
