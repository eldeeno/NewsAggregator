## News Aggregator API

This project is a backend service for a news aggregator. It fetches articles from multiple external news APIs (e.g., NewsAPI, The Guardian, New York Times) and stores them in a local database. The backend exposes API endpoints for retrieving articles with filtering and search capabilities.

The system uses queues and the Laravel scheduler to keep the local database updated with the latest news.
